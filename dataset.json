Now if you don't know what barbacoa is, I wish I could take you to Mexico City to El Hidalgense or maybe Arroyo or even better I would take you down into the southern state of Oaxaca to one of my favorite barbacoa restaurants called La Capilla but I can't so I'm going to show you how to get to that beautiful tender meat falling off the bone infused with classic Mexican flavor using a slow cooker. Yeah and it actually is incredibly good you don't have to build a pit in your backyard you just need to have a slow cooker and instead of using the traditional lamb or goat that you might find in central or southern Mexico I'm going to show you how to make it with beef short ribs. Now why short ribs and not like a chuck roast which you could use if you wanted to because the short rib has this incredibly magical texture and it reminds me more of what I get out of those beautiful pits in central and southern Mexico than just using a regular chuck roast. So I have put together four and a half but four and a half pounds about of beautiful short ribs. Now I'm working with a slow cooker here that has an insert that is usable on the stovetop that's why I'm always telling everybody you got to get one that has that stovetop safe insert. I put it directly over the fire there and I'm going to start heating it up because my first step here is going to be to brown them. Now in a classic Mexican barbacoa done in a wood-fired pit in the ground they don't do the browning step because they're putting it into this very very hot pit and it starts to brown sort of instantly but for our slow cooker version we have to actually create that brown quality to give depth of flavor to what we're doing here. So first thing is to put a little bit of oil in this slow cooker. If your slow cooker does not have a stovetop safe insert then you'll need to do this in a large skillet. I would prefer a 12 inch cast-iron pan because it holds heat and you can get a really good sear on things. Next thing I'm going to do is to sprinkle some salt evenly over the short ribs here and this will take a little more than what you might expect when you're seasoning meat you always want to get that on there. Then a couple at a time I'm going to lay these guys into this pan and start to sear them turning them until they are completely browned on all sides. Once those are browned I'll take them out and store them over here and then brown the other two but in the meantime I'm gonna make a classic adobo red chili adobo red chili marinade that they use in Oaxaca for their barbacoa. So we're gonna start with two dried chilies. Now if dried chilies seem to be like completely out of your purview I'm gonna suggest that you go online and buy these or go to a Mexican grocery store or perhaps your regular grocery store sells the whole chili pods. Much better flavor than what you would get out of a ground chili powder. Now this is an ancho chili I'm using a couple of these guys you just tear them open pull off the stem end of it and shake out all of the seeds and then I'm going to tear them up and put them into a blender jar. So these things are very they're kind of leathery feeling and you'll have to tear them I would say into about four pieces each. This is a slightly smaller of the ancho chilies so it'll be easier for me to tear up here and I'll do it in about three pieces there throw those in. These are guajillo chilies they already have the stem torn off of them so I'm just gonna open them up like this sometimes you'll see them this way in the store and then these are thin skinned and not so leathery as the the ancho chilies are and they add a very bright flavor. Now you're probably wondering why I'm combining the two that has to do with the fact that these have really bright flavor the anchos have a sweeter flavor. Are either one of them very hot? No this is not going to come out as a very hot dish but it's going to be one that is full of flavor. Now the next thing that I'm going to add is kind of hot I'm going to add a couple of these chipotle chilies to the mix here and those are going to be smoky slightly sweet and medium hot. I have four garlic cloves just peeled throw those guys in there. I need a couple of tablespoons of vinegar some people like it a little bit more tangy than the two tablespoons will give you but that's what I'm gonna be putting in mine today. I need a full teaspoon of salt that's gonna go in here and that's a measured amount we're not tasting this we're just starting off here with that one table teaspoon of salt and then I'm going to put in about a half a teaspoon of Mexican oregano about a half a teaspoon of ground Mexican cinnamon you can use any kind of cinnamon here but Mexican cinnamon is a slightly different flavor and variety and then the last thing that we have is some black pepper about a half a teaspoon of that I like the spice that are ground fresh so I've got a little mortar over here Mexican molcajete and I'm just gonna crush these these black peppercorns up and then add those to the blender jar. Two cups of water go in here and we're gonna blend this as absolutely smooth as possible these are beautifully browned now on all sides and we've got the marinade beautifully blended until it's very smooth I'm gonna turn this off and I don't really need all of this fat that's in here there's been a bunch that's rendered from the short ribs here so I'm just gonna tip this off over here if I can get it held right just so that I can get start with a slow cooker that basically just has a very little bit of fat in the bottom of it now this is the moment that we have to talk about the difference in style between barbacoa in the central part of Mexico and in the southern part in Oaxaca number one the barbacoa in central Mexico doesn't have this red chili marinade on it that we have made for this the Oaxacan one does in the central part of Mexico they wrap all of the meat before they put it into the pit in agave leaves really hard for us to do here in the United States but in Oaxaca they use leaves to season this to flavor it that are from the avocado tree and luckily online or in your Mexican grocery store you can buy these beautiful dried avocado leaves what do they taste like cross between say a bay leaf and a little something anise a little bit of that licorice flavor in there but it's gentle and it's really really delicious with the meat so in the slow cooker base here I'm going to put I don't know six or seven of these leaves in Oaxaca they love this flavor so much that they use a lot of these leaves here so I'm gonna put them down there a half of them down there and then I will nestle these guys in that are browned now and then we'll put some more of well we'll put the marinade over everything let's see if we can get that yeah that looks really nice there we've got our marinade last you saw this marinade it was just starting to blend now it is blended till it's incredibly smooth now I'm using this Vitamix blender which is a high-speed blender and it can blend it absolutely smooth if your blender doesn't blend very smooth I suggest that you set a medium mesh strainer over here and just pour it through to catch any of the tough skins that did not get completely blended here with this blender I don't really have to take that step so I'm going to pour the marinade now over the short ribs they're not submerged but there's a good amount of marinade there and we'll put the remaining avocado leaves here over the top now you want to make sure that they touch the marinade they're not just hovering above the marinade because the moisture is what will start to leach out their beautiful flavor so there you go with that we've got the top of the the slow cooker to go on and now all of this will just go into the slow cooker base we will go on high for well you can check it after four hours would be your minimum but usually it takes five to six hours for this to cook until that meat will completely fall off the bone okay it's been about five hours now five excruciating hours of smelling this deliciousness in the kitchen here and I think it's ready to go now we're gonna see how that will release all that beautiful steam and the really cool thing is that you can smell the avocado leaves they just add so much different dimension I would say you get a little of that anise like smell with them but they're also sort of just herby okay so I'm gonna just get rid of those leaves here they've done all that they can for the bottom aqua and then I'm gonna take the I'm gonna take the short ribs out and they should be fall off the bone tender at this point you can see how easy they just come right off the bone there but I want to take them all out because this is the point at which I have to judge what I want to do with this juice this really really delicious juice that is flavored with that red chili marinade and there's a lot of it in here and because I want to use this as a taco filling now if I was just gonna do it on a plate which is absolutely delicious I would keep this pretty brothy but for a taco presentation I want it to be less brothy I want to have the concentration shall we say of these beautiful juices now so I'm just gonna pick up the insert here to the slow cooker and just put it directly over the flame and then I can just allow that to reduce for a little while now you may think that it's a little fatty and so you may want to skip a skim a little bit of that fat off the top let me just show you what that is I think I'm gonna kind of leave it in here but I could just take some of that off like that and then I could even save this for sauteing some potatoes it'd be really good for that or you could just pitch it if you want to but I'm gonna let this reduce until it started to get some thickness so I notice a little bit of consistency it doesn't look so watery I'm just pulling the meat off of the bones here and shredding it with a fork you'll probably find right next to the bone a little connective tissue I usually just get rid of that because it's a little chewier than this absolutely luscious meat here it's a coarse shred I don't go very fine with that at all because I think it makes a better taco it stays in the taco better so we're gonna put that all here I don't know if you can hear this reducing juices I've been going for about a little over 10 minutes now they're starting to get a little noisier which means that the liquid has evaporated from them a lot I'm gonna turn this off now when you hear that sort of more of a sizzling thing it indicates that a lot of moisture has reduced out of it so they're they're noticeably thicker I want to give these a taste because I have to make sure that the salt is right on it this is what's really gonna give this its final flavor okay it's so good so I'm gonna just give it a little bit of salt here I'm gonna use a little bit of coarse salt when we make the tacos because I think that that's a really good thing with the juices here tipped up I'll just spoon some of them or ladle some of them over the meat and now that's where all of your really really wonderful flavor will come from here so I'm gonna save I'm not using all of it here I'm gonna save some of it off to the side make sure that the juices are evenly distributed down into the bottom of this gorgeous shredded short rib there and now let's build a taco so this is so iconic to me I think it's just absolutely spectacular to be able to have this long cooked meat with very traditional flavors and in very traditional Mexican style we will build these flat on a plate not trying to make them cupped up or anything this is what you would find certainly in every taqueria a little bit of this meat and for me this is a joy that should continue for quite some time meaning that you're not looking to just have one or two tacos here so just about an ounce and a half of meat on each one of them you've got lots of choices here to put on as garnishes on it I like salsa verde on this one you might like to get some Mexican hot sauce and put that over the top of this I like them both really it's something like a tomasula would work for that I like to sprinkle a little bit of chopped white onion over the top or you might like to slice your white onion for me just reinforcing the cilantro flavor that is in the green salsa is always really welcome to me and then I've got of course always a couple of limes that we can put on the plate there to give it that real beautiful brightness that contrasts so wonderfully to that slow-cooked short rib this is iconic in Mexico"}, {"title": "Huevos a la Mexicana | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img":

few things that you need to know. I'm going to show you how. So for years I have made huevos a la mexicana, which is exactly what this preparation is, and I didn't realize that you could call it a taco filling. I just scooped it into tortillas and maybe splashed it with some salsa and then made, well, I guess what you'd call a taco. But then when I went to Austin, Texas, they make sort of an art form out of breakfast tacos, and basically it's just huevos a la mexicana, sort of souped up and specialized for different people. And so I'm going to make what I think is just a really great basic version of it and talk to you about how you can soup it up if you want to do that. But I'm kind of partial to just the basic one. So the three ingredients that go in the base of it, of course, are tomatoes, onions, and green chili. The three, you can always think of them as the Mexican flag, which is red, white, and green. But these are the iconic flavors of the Mexican kitchen here. I just chopped up a couple of serrano chilies, my white onion, my tomato. I've got a pan heating over here on about a medium high. Now, two things that are really important to make really good huevos a la mexicana. One is the fat you use, and the other is the heat you use. Okay, so I'm going to be doing this with some rendered bacon fat. You could use olive oil, you could use vegetable oil. Butter sort of gives it a different kind of flavor, so you might not want to use butter in this. But hey, if butter is your thing, then do it with butter. If you have really good fresh rendered pork lard, to me that is one of the absolute best. But you can get this flavor of bacon in it by just using some rendered bacon fat there. I don't know about you, but I always save that, put it in a jar in the refrigerator, because it is so great to add or to use for sauteing some things, especially potatoes for breakfast. So I can smell that beautiful bacon flavor now. And as soon as this is hot and completely melted, we're going to add these ingredients to it. But we're over medium high heat, and we have to have it hot, because we want to get a very good sear on it. Now I've cracked eight eggs into this bowl, but I have to show you this. How often do you crack eight eggs and two of them are double yoked? You have to come in and look at this thing, because this one and this one are double yoked eggs. Now the eggs that we use at our restaurant all come from a local farmer, and so you're more likely in that situation to get double yoked eggs. But I thought this is a really special time here. Okay, I'm going to measure the amount of salt that's going to go into these eight eggs. I'm going to put a teaspoon of salt. Usually for every four eggs, it's a half a teaspoon of salt, which I pulled out the half teaspoon, so I'll do two of those. And then you could put pepper in it if you want. That's not very common in Mexico, but if you want to do that, you can do it. Okay, now I've got hot fat here, and I'm going to just slide all of this goodness into the pan, and we're going to cook it until it starts to brown, all done over medium-high heat. This has been about six minutes, and I think it's looking really nice. You've got to reduce all the water out of those tomatoes, and so that's why it takes a little time, and you want to get some color on the onion, not just to get it to that sweet softness, but to get some browning going on in there. Some people might like to throw in a little bit of garlic at this point. Feel free to do that. I'm going to beat the eggs with the salt, not putting anything else in them. They've got plenty of other things in this skillet to sort of soften them up, and I want to just beat it until I no longer see streaks of yellow and the white there, and then I'm going to put them into the pan. Now, this is the point where you have to make your decision. Are you going to do the fluffy, high-heat scramble or the creamier, low-temperature scramble? I tend to always go toward the low-temperature scramble, but I will tell you, in culinary school, they only teach you the other version because in a lot of restaurants, you're just working really fast, so you do the really high temperature. I'm going to turn mine down, but remember, it's going to be a hot pan that we're going into here, so it's going to start off kind of hot, but then since I turned the temperature down, it's going to go into a slower scramble. Now, I'm working in a nonstick pan, which is what I really recommend to everybody to do. It will make your life so much easier at the end. A 10-inch nonstick pan is one of my go-to things in the kitchen, and you'll notice that what I'm doing is starting around the outside of the pan like that and sort of pulling toward the middle, and I'm just going to keep doing that until I get the eggs done as I like. I like them to be soft, so I'm going to stop before they have fully cooked through, and I always recommend this to everybody. There is heat in this pan, and it will continue to cook the eggs for another minute or so after you've turned the heat off, so I always recommend stopping before the doneness that you really like. I'm getting really close here. It takes a little longer than maybe you expect to do this slow scramble here, but this has taken me about three minutes or so to do this, but it's still shiny on the top. That means that it's going to be really, really tender, but I'm just going to let them sit in the pan here for just a minute while we go on to the other toppings that go on this. Now, this is a point at which you could have been scrambling other things in there. You could do bacon, or you could do ham in there. At our restaurant, we do shrimp in there, which is really special. I'm going to put avocado on the top, but you could just dice it and then scramble that into the mixture. There's all kinds of fun things. You could go all the way to making machacado con huevo, which is made with shredded jerky, but that's a topic for another one of our videos, so you'll have to look that one up, but there's lots of different things that you could add in, including different kinds of vegetables. I've got some beautiful cilantro here, and I've got the avocado. Warm tortillas are at hand over here to put out on the plate. I'm going to show you how I like to do these guys in the very traditional Mexican style, which is to spread the tortillas out on the plate. Take a spoonful of eggs to go onto each one. I mean, it sounds like I'm making something real big and special out of this, but these are just scrambled egg tacos, but I will say what to me makes them so wonderful is the avocado, cilantro, and salsa that you could put on each one of these things, and I always like to serve those separately so that everyone can have an opportunity to put them on as much as they or as little as they like. We've got our leaves of cilantro to just lay on top of it, and I don't like to chop it so much for this, but you could chop it if you like to have the distribution a little different, but I like big mouthfuls of it. If you want, you could put some Valentina hot sauce or some Tamazula hot sauce, Mexican hot sauce, out for everyone to enjoy with their breakfast tacos. I've got this little chipotle salsa over here, which I think is really delicious with it, so maybe just a spoonful of that on each one of these tacos, and I've got to shut up now because I want to dive into those things. Man, this is honest to God one of my absolute favorite breakfasts."}, {"title": "Slow Cooker Mole with Chicken | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAB0FwPj8y8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCtHd3QRGXQ7A4cnhNOoKvxnKW8Dw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAB0FwPj8y8&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=3&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "The next page in our taco manual focuses on one of my favorites when I lived in Mexico City and that's chicken tacos with red mole. Now I think probably everybody would expect me to just buy one of those mole pastes that you can get in any Mexican grocery store and dilute it down with some chicken stock and mix it with some chicken and say we've got chicken tacos in mole. But that's not what I'm gonna do because I haven't found one of those mole pastes that I really love. So instead I decided to take the essence of mole, incorporate a piece of kitchen equipment that I use a fair amount which is my slow cooker and see if I could hit that real true flavor of mole and I did it. So I'm going to show you how to make this mole in the fastest version that I've ever worked with at all using our slow cooker. Okay so we're gonna start with the chilies that go into mole. I wish I could tell you could just use one dried chili but when I tried it with that the flavor wasn't complex enough. This needs the three classic chilies that go into a mole poblano, red mole central Mexico. So we have a chile mulato looks just like the chile ancho but it's darker. We're gonna start with six of those. We have three of these ancho chiles which are a more cranberry red maybe you can see that there and then we've got four of these pasilla chilies the long very very dark ones. Of course what you have to do is to pull out the the stems. I wish there was an easy way to do this or you could buy these guys already stemmed and seeded but you will have to go through this part of it but it's what's gonna make this taste like somebody's grandma's homemade mole. Okay so you just get all of the seeds out of there stem off then tear it into smaller pieces about an inch. You might want to use a pair of scissors for this and then I've got all of these guys right here. We're going to do a frying, toasting of the chilies and a lot of other stuff that's gonna go in here and you have to choose the fat that you're gonna do it in. Most of you will probably reach for a jar of vegetable oil for this. If you want the really true flavor of Mexico then a beautiful fresh rendered pork lard would be the thing to work with. You can find that at the meat market in your Mexican grocery store or at a butcher's. Don't buy the prepackaged stuff get it from a good source if you're gonna use the lard. All of those chilies perhaps are gonna go in here and we're going to add to that about 3 quarters of a cup of almonds. They can be skin on or skin off. Most people in Mexico would do it with skin on. About a half a cup of raisins and four whole large garlic cloves. All of that just goes in here and we will start the sauteing now. I had been heating this for a little while so that that lard would would melt fast and then it'll take about five minutes of standing here stirring it. So that this is sort of getting the ingredients together it's sort of the hardest part of this if you want to know the truth. And standing here for five minutes really is a lot less work than if you were to make the classic mole poblano which would probably take you five or six hours. I've got this down to less than an hour of actual time that I am engaged in the preparation of the mole. Just take a look at this and you can see that the edges of the chilies have a little toast on them. A lot of them have lightened up in color. That's exactly what we're looking for. I never really stopped stirring this at all because the chilies can burn and I'm working over a sort of medium-high fire. Next step here is going to be to put a can of fire roasted tomatoes. One of those about 15 ounce cans in there. Stir it in really well and then we have to reduce all the juice in that. So it'll take a minute or so and while it's doing its thing here I'm gonna come over here to the to this little molcajete, this little mortar here and I'm gonna grind up the spices. I like fresh ground you can use ground already ground spices if you would like. What I didn't put in here is anise seeds. You can go for quarter to a teaspoon excuse me a quarter to a half teaspoon of anise seeds depending on how much you like that flavor. I also have a half a teaspoon of black pepper. What will give me about a half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon here but I'm gonna have to work on that back and forth until I get it ground up. I also have some cloves in there what would be about an eighth of a teaspoon of cloves that are gonna be in here. Then just crush that. I'm a very active cook so I don't mind doing this kind of stuff but it does take a fair amount of elbow grease as we called it when I was growing up to get this to grind into a really smooth powder. Okay you could you could break a sweat doing this kind of grinding but I think I'm gonna stop right there you can still see tiny little flecks of the the cinnamon the Mexican canela. I'm gonna put that in here I can see now that we have reduced all of the juices in the tomatoes so I'm gonna put in the last few ingredients that are gonna go in here. A couple cups of water some of you may be surprised with that thinking it would only be chicken stock in here. I like the way the flavors come out better when you're working with water at this stage. You'd like a thick piece of bread I had a Mexican telera but a thick piece of bread that darkly toasted and just break that up in here and then we have the chocolate that we're going to put in at the same time. So it's just about an ounce of chocolate. Chocolate in a classic mole is not the main flavor in fact it is really one of the flavors like the cinnamon and black pepper. It's something that enhances everything doesn't dominate anything. Alright stir that up we just have some seasonings I'm gonna give a very introductory seasoning level going on in here. I'm gonna put three tablespoons of sugar in there that's what brings out the flavor of the chilies and I'm gonna put a couple of teaspoons of salt. We will revisit those seasonings when we get back to the very end of it here and we have finished mole in the slow cooker. At this point we are ready to put this on to the the slow cooker and set it up for its long slow simmer. So I'm gonna drop this in here I'm working with a really old crock pot here that has an insert that can be put directly over. I always recommend that you work with that kind of a slow cooker because it gives you so much more flexibility. If yours does not have a stovetop safe insert I suggest that you do all of this in a large skillet and scrape it into your slow cooker. Top goes on and now we're going to set the time and temperature. I'm gonna turn it on to low and then I'm gonna set the time for six hours and we'll let that cook and I'll show you what that looks like in six hours. Okay I don't know if you want to post this picture on your Instagram or not but that's what it looks like when it is it has been doing its thing for six hours there. I'm gonna take this out because our next step is to do the blending and we want to go right back into this crock for the final simmering. So I'm gonna take all of this out. You'll notice that almost all the liquid has now reduced so we'll put this mixture in. Literally it doesn't look like it's going to be a good dish but wait till you taste it. It is super delicious and tasty and because of this long slow simmering all of those flavors will come together in a great way and it'll really taste like mole. Okay last little bit here with my towel I'm just gonna scrape this stuff into this bowl. Now I'm gonna put this this insert to the crock pot back here so that we can go right back into it but I am going to now blend in two batches here the this mixture this cooked down mole what I would call a mole base with each of these these batches that I'm blending being having about a cup and a half of broth. What we're trying to do is just to facilitate all of this blending. Put the top of it on and we're gonna let this run until it's completely smooth. Okay let's see what this looks like now it should be quite smooth if your blender ever stalls then just add a little bit more of the chicken broth to it and then we'll just pour this in here you see how smooth and beautiful it's like velvety in texture. So we'll put that in here and then go back with the second batch and another cup and a half or so of chicken stock. I got six cups all together that's what's gonna go in here eventually anyway. So that much in there and go for another round of blending. Okay I think we're another smooth batch here so I'll pour that in to the slow cooker. You'll see that this makes a lot of this is the smallest amount you could make in a slow cooker but it makes a lot of mole which is really great for you because you can quickly make this mole quick in terms of mole making and then you have some that you can put in the freezer for another time. I'm gonna put the rest of our six cups total of the chicken broth in here and now we are ready to set this on high and I'm gonna put it on for two hours right there. We'll come back and see what this looks like at the end of this final simmering time. Final step here we've gotten this simmered now for a couple of hours. Obviously we got to taste it. This makes about 10 cups total of mole. Okay it's a little under seasoned. I'm gonna say about a tablespoon more of sugar. This is the hardest part for a lot of people who haven't made mole before because sugar is an essential element in this. If you don't put enough sugar in it then it will the flavor of the chilies will not come forward and about a teaspoon or so of salt. I'm gonna just stir that in and then give it another taste to see where we are seasoning wise. After you've made a lot of mole you'll have a good sense of where you're going seasoning wise. Okay now it's all now it's working. For these little chicken tacos after you've spent all that time and energy in that mole I suggest that you just buy like a rotisserie chicken but you may have other ideas for the chicken part of this. This was just like a two and a half pound rotisserie chicken. Pulled all the skin off and the meat off of the bones and tore it into coarse shreds here. I'm gonna take about a couple of cups of this mole and just splash that all over this chicken. This is the way this is typically served not with a mole on the top but actually with a mole mixed in to the chicken meat. The coarse shreds of the chicken. I'm gonna use a pair of tongs here to get that mixed nicely. So look in there and you'll see kind of what I'm looking for. A nice coating of mole on here. I've got some warm tortillas for these oh so classic flavored tacos here. So we'll put a couple of those guys down. Some of the chicken. If you want you could splash a little bit more of the mole over the top. That's just about a nice look for me. Take a little bit more of the mole that's in there. This really gets me excited because this flavor is unlike any other flavor in the whole wide world. This is the crowning or the crown jewel of the Mexican kitchen. And there you've got classic chicken tacos with red mole that you made yourself from scratch but with not too much effort. Okay the tacos were a success. Everybody's happy and you're staring at eight cups more of this mole in front of you. So what do you do with it? Well first of all you need to know your options of how you can use it. Mole on enchiladas is one of my absolute favorite dishes or during the warm weather months if you're going to be doing some grilling. Grilled chicken breasts or grilled shrimp even with this mole is really spectacular. I suggest that you break it down into two cup increments so that you can defrost a little or a lot depending on what your needs are. I love these pint containers like this. I use masking tape on the top of it. Write red mole the date so that I don't lose track of when I made it. Put these into the freezer. I always recommend that you do the defrosting in the refrigerator overnight. That will be a nice long slow defrost. But if you open the top of it and it looks a little what I would call broken. It doesn't look smooth and velvety like it does right here. Just know that a quick spin through the blender and it'll all come right back together and you can have a treasure in your freezer that you will be very happy to have."}, {"title": "Your Guide to Easy Homemade Corn Tortillas | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4JBHQS-DEbI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAYbdoAaU0me78qjxZZCjv-IrkvyQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JBHQS-DEbI&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=4&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "The best tortillas are the homemade tortillas. Welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is one of the most essential pages. It's the recipe for corn tortillas, and let's face it, your taco's only as good as the tortilla that you wrap it in. So I'm going to show you how to make corn tortillas from scratch at home with masa that's either dehydrated or fresh. I'm going to show you the whole thing, but let's just talk about what is corn masa that you use for making the corn tortilla. First of all, it starts with field corn. That is this stuff here. This is an olotillo corn from the southern part of Mexico. This is not dehydrated sweet corn. It's a grain corn, and that is what you used to make the corn tortillas, but it's not just ground up. So you can't really call this stuff that comes in this package as cornmeal because it's first processed and it's processed with an alkali bath. They put the stuff that they call cal or mineral lime into the water and boil the corn for a short period of time, let it sit overnight, and then it is stone ground in these beautiful mills all over Mexico. It's not a substance that you can keep for long periods of time. So they'll take that paste that comes out of the mill and dehydrate and powder that, and that's what you'll find in your grocery store. So I have two different kinds of masa harina or masa flour, not corn flour, but masa flour here. The one that you can find pretty much everywhere is the Maseka brand. And then our friends at Masienda are making heirloom corn masa harina, which I highly recommend because you're going to get flavor. Let's face it. Maseka is distributed all over Mexico, so there's no regional flavor to it. It's made that way. Whereas Masienda is capturing the regional flavors of Mexico and offering them to you in your kitchen. So I'm going to do my basic recipe here, which is going to be a cup and three quarters of masa harina. I'm going to start with that and then we're going to compare the consistency with fresh ground masa, which I have for you here as well. So I've got my, this is a cup and a half, and then I'm going to add about a quarter of a cup more there. And then the next ingredient is water. So we're going to go to the sink and I'm going to get really hot tap water. So I want to make sure that this is as hot as my tap water gets. Some place in that hundred and thirty degree temperature would be good. And you want a generous cup. It's really about a cup and two tablespoons, and I'm going to add that in here. And then I am just going to mix it all together. There's many different ways to mix this spoons, forks, spatulas, whatever you want, but there's nothing really better than your fingers to work the water into the dried masa. Now consistency is super important here. So don't just go by the measurements that I gave you because it will change all the time depending on the humidity in the air. I'm seeing that this is going to come out like really dry. So I'm just going to step back to the sink and I'm going to put some more water into it so that I can get it to the right kind of consistency. This seems like it was quite, quite dry, this mix. Now another thing that I will tell you, when you're working with masa, water goes a long way. So when you say, oh, this needs just a little touch more moisture, you put in a tablespoon and it might feel like all of a sudden it's gotten too soft. Okay, so just go a little bit at a time as you're working all of this together. Now the one wonderful thing about working with this heirloom corn is that it has a way, way more aromatic character to it. So compared to say the maseca there, this will be a real pleasure to work with. Okay, so look at what I've got here. A lot of people would say, oh yeah, that's right. It holds together. So it's probably right. This is what I would consider that consistency more like a play dough. It's pretty stiff, but we want our masa to actually be a little bit softer than that. So I'm going to add, I add a little bit of just regular tap water at room temperature over here so that I could kind of add that to it. And I'm going to add it just not even a tablespoon at a time until I get it to this soft consistency. Now I have taught making of tortillas for years. And I will tell you that the number one thing that people do is work with a masa that's too stiff because they say that, oh, it's really stiff is going to be easy to work with. Yeah, but your tortillas are going to be dry and crumbly. So when I get this set now, almost to the consistency that I want it to be, I'm going to put a towel over the top of it and let it sit for about 20, 30 minutes to completely rehydrate. And then I'll meet you back here to show you the forming and the baking of the tortillas. It's been about 15 minutes since we added the hot water to this masa arena. And what I have in this bowl here, obviously you can see the difference in color, but this is white corn that was made as fresh masa. So this was started as the whole kernel corn cooked in the alkali bath, let sit overnight and then stone ground this morning. This came from our restaurant and it was made to the perfect consistency with a little bit of water by someone on our staff that has made tens of thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of tortillas over the years. So this is going to be my benchmark. I'm going to get this masa to match this one in consistency. Right now, if I touch this one, it feels a little stiffer than this one. So I'm going to add a little bit more water to it. Again, you see I'm going very light in it because a little water goes a long way when you are working with masa. Okay. I'm going to say that this pretty much matches the other one now. So let's talk about the difference. Clearly the masa harina is very easy for people because you can keep this on your shelf in your kitchen and grab it at any time. This masa, you have to go to a tortilla factory to get it and you want to buy it the same day that you're going to work with it because it will spoil pretty fast. I will tell you that you can refrigerate it, but the best tortillas will come from room temperature masa. So most of you will be working with this masa harina that has been reconstituted and I write all of my recipes for either so that whichever is the right one for you, it can be used in the recipes. Okay. So now I think I've got the same consistency here. This one's a little bit softer, I mean a little bit stiffer, but we're going to work through it and see what happens because we're going to make tortillas with both of them. This is going to give you, I will say the lightest, freshest flavor and the masa harina will give you a slightly different texture. Both are good. Both are worth doing. Okay. So we've got a tortilla press here. This is one of the Oaxacan ones, also sold by our friends at Masienda. It's a really beautiful piece to have at home, but many of you will probably have a cast iron or a cast aluminum tortilla press and those around the Oaxacan ones for some reason are always square. So you open that up and you want to cut two pieces of plastic to go in here. These are cut from vegetable bags from the grocery store. A little bit thicker than this is a little easier to use if you are starting this for the first time. You'll take about a walnut size piece of the dough, a little bit big there, roll it between your palms and put one, put the ball down on one piece of the plastic that is covering the bottom plate of the tortilla press. Then you will put the other piece of plastic on top and press the ball down. Then you will close this press and you'll give it a gentle press. Now you're not putting your whole body weight into this because it will be so thin if you do that that you won't be able to unmold it. So give it a gentle press and open it up and let's take a look. It should be around four and a half, five inches, something like that is a really good size to start with the first time that you're making tortillas. Flip it around 180 degrees, close the press and give it a gentle press again. That will just even it out. The more even your tortilla, the more likely it is to press, to puff up like pita bread. Then pull off that top sheet of plastic and this is the part that takes some dexterity and getting used to. You are going to use your hand and line up the top of the tortilla with your, your top finger there and then you are going to just drape the tortilla over your hand and you are going to let it dangle like that. Then we're going to go over to a griddle, heat it to sort of a medium on one side, medium high on the other and then we are going to get it off of our hands. Now most of the time people would think you would just roll it off this way. It will always be wrinkled. If you do that, you do, this is the standard Mexican procedure. In most places in Mexico, you will catch the tortilla on the griddle like that and roll your hand out from underneath it. One little break there on the side, but otherwise it came down just right. Let's go back through that again while this is baking on that cooler side of the griddle. But this time, why don't we take the, I'm going to make a two colored masa thing here because I've got a lot of the yellow on my fingers here. But let's take the masa that is fresh ground corn masa here and take our walnut sized piece in the middle, put the plastic on top and press it down. Close it and give it a gentle press. Open that up, flip it around and I keep wanting to do it before I close there and then give it a gentle press again. Open it up. Well that didn't work at all. So let's just start. One nice thing about masa is you can just re-roll the ball. It's not at all like anything that is flour. And this will happen to you from time to time. Press that down again. I'm going to give it a gentle press down, flip it around and press it again. Now what we'll notice before I get to that, I have to flip this. Okay, what you'll notice is that it starts to dry around the outside and it will release itself from the griddle. If it's still sticking to the griddle, you know that it is not ready to be turned yet, but you don't want to go too long on this either. So I'm going to take it and flip it over onto the hot side of the griddle and we're going to let that bake for about 60 seconds. So it'll be some place between 30 and 60 seconds depending on the temperature of my griddle. I'll pull the top plastic off here. I'm going to unmold it onto my hand, but I am again lining it up with my top finger there and then peeling off the plastic so that it dangles there. Come over to the griddle and lay this down onto the griddle like that and that keeps it in together. Now, one of the things I noticed is that the consistency of the fresh ground masa is more pliable. The masarina one is a little less pliable and will have a tendency to stick just a little bit or break just a little bit, not stick just a little bit, but break just a little bit. Okay, so now we're going to see if we got this, if we get any kind of a puff here. Okay, my second flip on the yellow corn tortilla has given us just little bubbles all over the surface of it. We're going to get ready to do the second flip now on the one that is made from fresh ground masa. And of course the holy grail is a completely puffed one, but even people who are like long-term tortilleras that taught me everything that I know, they don't even get it on every single one. So we want to get a little browning going on like that. We got a little puffing, which will make it a lighter consistency tortilla. You can see that this one is puffing really nicely here. It hasn't gotten the full puff, the full pita-like puff, but it's doing really nicely. It's coming up and that's kind of what we're looking for. Okay, so I'm going to set these, the cooking isn't completed here on the griddle. It is actually completed when you put it into a basket with a towel. And as you're making your tortillas, you just open up the towel and put them in here stacked one on the other and let them just steam. So they may be a little crispy in some places on the edges, but that'll all go away as they're steaming here and finishing it. Okay, so there's several things that you need to know. When you are working with your masa and you press out your first tortilla, the edges of that tortilla should be smooth. That is really critical. That is what will tell you if the consistency of your masa is right or not. So when you pull the top sheet off, if the edge, and I'm going to ask you to come in and look, is really rough here, then you know that it's too dry. If it's smooth like what you see here, you know it's the right consistency. That's number one. Number two, you have to get this motion down of how to get that tortilla off of your hand. Some people are just kind of natural at it. Other people are not. So let me just show you how I always encourage everybody to work with this. Unmold it onto your hand because you're working with masa and it's very easy to work with. Unmold it. Again, I'm lining it up with the top finger there. Unmold it completely and then do it on a work surface like this. So learn how to roll that out so that you get it unwrinkled onto the work surface. And then you can just pick it up and keep working with the same ball of dough until you get it exactly right and you feel really comfortable. Over at the griddle here, when you get to this point, lots of people think they're going to burn the back of their hand, their little finger there. And so they jerk like that. And of course it just folds the tortilla over on itself. And you have to let that one sit for a little while until it releases itself and then throw it in the trash because you can't really use that tortilla. Now, a lot of people have trouble with getting the temperatures right here. When you put it down on the cooler end of the griddle, you may see a bubble or two, but it shouldn't really bubble up at all at that point. Neither should you leave it too long, just a little drying around the edge. And just that the moment that it releases itself from the griddle is the moment you flip it over. You notice that I'm doing it in typical Mexican style with my hands. You don't have to. You can use a spatula to do that, a metal spatula to help you through all of that sort of thing. Once you have flipped it onto the hotter side and you let it sit there for a few seconds, well, I would say 30 to 45, 50, 60 seconds to brown a little bit underneath. And then you give it the second flip. At that point, you want to tickle it just a little bit, meaning that you want to press down on it. And that will help that sort of puff to start, and you will get a better textured tortilla out of it. So those are little tricks that you need to know to be an expert tortilla maker. Just know that it's one of those dexterity things. And after you do it for a while, you'll feel really comfortable with it. But just like making bread the first time, it feels so foreign. So just know that. Just keep after it, doing it time and time again. And I think you'll agree with me that the best tortillas are the homemade tortillas. Okay, so you saw me go through all of the steps of making great corn tortillas at home. Now I'm going to introduce you to someone who makes them for a living and absolutely makes them perfect. I'm a rank amateur compared to the hands that you see working here, but I'm just going to go over all of the steps so that you can see it's all still the same. You see that the pressing out is exactly what I showed you. There's no trick to that. But then when it's unmolded and then it gets laid down, did you see that movement, pulling the hand out from underneath the tortilla like that? So this is the coolest part of the griddle, just like what I explained to you back at my house. And then things get flipped over once and then flipped over a second time. And you can see that these are just starting to puff gloriously up to that level of being just like pita bread. So it's exactly what I showed you. But you can also see that this is sort of a lifelong process of perfection. And when you get one like this that's been completely puffed, this is that same heirloom corn masa that I was working with back at my house. There is nothing like it. Now you know that these don't have any fat in them. They don't have any salt in them. And there's no gluten in them. Corn tortillas are about the healthiest thing on the planet. And one of the reasons that we season everything so much in the Mexican kitchen is because these don't have any salt in them. They don't have any fat in them. So just like in Chinese food with unsalted white rice, you really develop the flavors quite boldly so that then they will contrast with the daily bread. Now it's time for you to get to work."}, {"title": "BIRRIA TACOS | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4goWRdnF-EU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLASMDNNvd1uosctK_jIXNSyqJSj2A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4goWRdnF-EU&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=5&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Mmm, birria. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a Hello, everyone, and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is birria. Yes, birria. It's really having a moment here in the United States, though it has been a super popular taco filling and entree in Mexico for, shall we say, centuries. Now, in Mexico, it is often made with different kinds of meat. Where it's the most famous, which is West Central Mexico, Guadalajara and around in that area, it is typically made either with goat or with lamb. And I have that right here in front of me. This piece of goat meat here is part of the leg meat. This lamb is a lamb shoulder roast. You want to get the ones with the bones in, if at all possible. Now, you may be asking, where could I find goat, that very common thing in Mexico? Well, you would look in a Mexican grocery store or in a Middle Eastern grocery store. Oftentimes, you will find goat there as well. What does goat taste like if you haven't ever had it? I always say it tastes a little bit like a cross between pork and lamb. So it's a little richer in flavor than lamb is and a little more succulent if you get a small lamb. Now, in other parts of Mexico, especially in the north, they will make birria out of beef. So I have a piece of chuck here, a piece of chuck if you can get it with the bones in it. But I will tell you that if you want to have the absolute most luxurious birria that you have ever had or could ever have, then I would use short rib. So get a big chunk of short rib and use that. We're always looking for someplace around 4 pounds. If it doesn't have bones, around 3 pounds for the recipe that I'm going to show you. What is birria made into a taco? Well, it is the meat that is slow simmered in a light red chili sauce. And then you take the meat out and brown it up a little bit. And you dash it with some of that delicious juice. And almost always when you get a birria taco, you will get a little cup of the braising juices on the side, which just makes everybody absolutely happy. You dip it in there and it's just absolutely delicious. Queso birria? Well, that's a topic for another time. Okay, so what do you have to do to turn these pieces of meat into birria? Well, first you got to make a marinade. I'm going to make this birria marinade from Guajillo chili. So it's a smooth skin chili and it has a sort of cranberry red color to it. You want to choose ones that have this really dark cranberry color to them because they're going to be the most flavorful. Of course, you have to process through them all by taking the stem end off. And then I just use my finger. Some people like to use scissors to do it, but it slows me down too much. So I just use my finger to tear open the side of it. Now, when you do open it up, you'll see that some of the seeds will be still attached to the seed pod and veins. So you want to kind of pull those out and then shake out all of the seeds here. And then I always tear them into large pieces, flat pieces. That's going to make this whole thing go really fast. So I've already done all the rest of the chilies here and we're going to go over to the... I have a griddle going here. You'll probably want to use a large 12-inch skillet for this kind of thing if you don't have a double burner griddle like this one. But we need to toast these. Their flavor is so enhanced if you toast them. And what I like to do is to spread them into a single layer on the griddle for even toasting. I know not everybody does this, but for even toasting, I will say I like to just press them down. This is the reason that I like to work with them in flat pieces because this goes so incredibly well. And as they start to toast, they will change color slightly. On the inside, you will notice that they start to actually lighten up in color. If you can see this, how much lighter it is on this section, that is the color that we're looking for. And as they toast and lighten up in color, they will also release a lot of their aroma into the kitchen. So I'm going to press this down. My griddle is always much cooler on one end than it is in the middle. So now I moved everything back to the center where it's way, way warmer, way hotter, so that I can then do this toasting a little bit faster. I use my nose for this a lot. And when I really smell the aroma of the chilies released, I know that they are getting really close. But they also change color, as I showed you just a moment ago. You'll notice that on the back here of my griddle, I have some whole cloves of garlic. But they're whole cloves of garlic that are in their papery skins. And I am roasting those there. You can do that alongside the chilies as you're working here. They'll take about 15 minutes to get completely soft. Soft is what you're looking for here. And they will probably get little black spots on them in places. So as I'm working through this here, I will meet you back when I've got them all toasted and we're ready to rehydrate them. These chilies just smell so good. Just hot tap water is, to me, the best way to rehydrate them. Some people boil them, but I think it takes too much of their flavor away. When I get enough of the hot tap water here so that they float freely, I'm going to put a plate on top of them, just so that it keeps them submerged here. And they will rehydrate evenly. I'm going to let them go for about 20 minutes. Okay, the garlic has cooled off enough that I can handle it here. And I am peeling the papery skin off of that. That will go into this blender jar here. I'll collect all of that there. We have now our rehydrated dried chilies, which are really the star of the show for this marinade. And I'm going to put all of them into this blender jar as well. Just pick them up and slide them in here. Now, one thing that you do have to know is that the guajillo chili, while it has a really bright flavor and very mild heat, does have a very tough skin. So I'm using a high-speed blender here, a Vitamix. If you don't have a high-speed blender, you will probably want to strain this mixture after you blend it, just because those skins are really tough. So I measured one cup of the soaking liquid for the chilies. And now I'm going to put the spices in here. About a teaspoon of Mexican oregano will go in. And I have cumin and black pepper. Mexican oregano, cumin, and black pepper are sort of a triumvirate that you see in a lot of recipes, especially ones that are red chili sauces in that west-central section of Mexico. I always keep a small moncajete, that's the lava rock grinding stone from Mexico. I keep a small one right beside my stove so that I can crush spices right before I use them so that they're the most flavorful. Once I get them started, it's the black pepper that you have to kind of go in there and get started by crushing it. Then I do a circular motion to actually turn it into a real powder here. And boy, that aroma is really dynamic as well. So the black pepper and cumin will go in. I always keep a little brush by my moncajete there so that I can use that to get that out. Okay, now we've got three tablespoons of vinegar. I'm using an apple cider vinegar. And then I'm going to put in a real big generous teaspoon of salt. This recipe is going to get more salt as we go along because that wouldn't be enough for all of the meat that we're using. But this will get us started in the flavoring of the marinade itself. So now comes the blending. You always want to do this on high and you want to do it until you can feel this sauce between your fingers and notice that most all of the chili skin has been blended smooth. A lot of noise there. You can see that it's actually heated up by the blades of the blender there. So I'm putting all of this over the piece of lamb that I'm using here, that lamb shoulder roast that I showed you before. So that just goes all over this. And I'm going to... It covered it really beautifully, but I'm going to add now four cups of water and I'm going to pour that sort of around the outside of this. And the technique for cooking that I'm going to show you is the braising technique. So usually when you're braising things, it will be about half submerged. The meat will be about half submerged, and that's kind of what we've got here. I'm going to put the top on this. You want to do this like in a large Dutch oven. Something heavy is the best piece of equipment for this kind of thing. But if you're a slow cooker person, hey, do it in a slow cooker. You will reduce the water to one cup, okay, because there's not as much evaporation in that. This has four cups in it. I've set my oven to 325 degrees. So I'm going to slide this in here and I'm going to cook it for about three hours. After two and a half hours, I'll go in and check it and make sure that not too much of the liquid has simmered away. This is the moment that you always wait for, of course, because you pull it out and you take the top off of it. If you've been cooking this in a slow cooker, of course, it's already filled the house with that delicious aroma for hours and hours and hours. So let's see what we've got here. I took a peek earlier just to make sure that it had the right amount of liquid around in it. So look at that. Well, it is incredibly aromatic. Now, I am going to take the meat out of here first and remember that it will probably come out in big chunks, which we will then break into smaller pieces. But we want to work on this braising liquid now. So we've got the big pieces of the meat out. Now, I need some fat for this. So I'm actually going to pull a ladle up here and tip this up on the side and then collect all the fat off the top. So you don't want to be doing this with a really lean cut. That's why I'm always choosing to use something like a shoulder roast because there's usually a fair amount of fat. And remember, I did not encourage you to cut any of the fat off of this. But now we're going to degrease this broth because we're going to use the fat both to brown some of this meat up right before we serve it and also to kind of crisp some tortillas. This is a very standard part of making really good birria. I need to measure and see how much of this braising liquid we actually have to work with here. So I'm going to pour this into a measuring cup because I need about two cups of it. Let's see what we've got. Well, it looks like I hit exactly two cups. If it was more than that, I would encourage you to boil it down until you reach that concentration, that two cup concentration. But here I'm going to just simply put it on a very low heat so that it is hot when we want to serve it. Now our next step here, and all of this, by the way, can be done well in advance of your serving. So I always suggest to people that they get their birria made, get the meat off of the bones, work through. I've got a lot of little bones here that I'm pulling out. And then you just look at how incredibly tender that meat is. It just falls into large and coarse shreds. There's a little bit more I can get off of that, but mostly that is just bone there. Let's look over here in this piece. So you'll see that this is going to come off and let this bone come out in one great big piece. And I think that's going to be kind of what we want to look at there. I can use a knife on a lot of these bigger pieces to help me cut them into large shreds, but just a couple of these pieces like that. So you'll see what I'm going to do here. I use my knife more as a shredding device, like that. But everything that's small, you'll be able to just tear up with a pair of tongs. Look at how beautiful that exterior piece of the birria is. Okay. Okay, that is just very, very beautifully shredding on its own there. Okay. Now, I have a large skillet that is on the back here. This is best done with a nonstick skillet or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, if that's what you have access to. But I have it here on about a medium-high heat. And my next step is going to be to take some of this fat, just a little bit of this fat. That was a little bit of the braising juices there, so I got a little bit more than just the fat. And now I'm going to put the meat in here so I can start to crisp it a little bit. If you've been to a birrieria, you notice that a lot of them don't do this step, but my favorite ones are the ones that brown the meat a little bit before they make tacos for you. So that's my standard way of doing it. Browned meat always, to me, has more flavor. So we'll just let this crisp up for a minute or two here, and then we're ready to start making tacos. I'm going to give a little seasoning to our broth here. If it looks thick, thin it out a little bit, because this should be like a consomme, is what they would call it in Mexico, or a broth. Let me just stir that in and give it a taste, see where we are. It would be great for dipping these little birria tacos. So I've got tortillas here, and I am going to show you the sort of standard technique. Now, lots of taquerias will heat their tortillas by putting them, dipping them in a little bit of oil. So no different here, but I like about a third into the fat that we've separated out. And then I just move them around so that you can be sure that they're completely coated. If you'd like to flip them over, that's fine too, just to make sure that they're nice and evenly coated here. That all looks good. Now we've got our meat that has browned nicely here. The browned meat to me is the real trick to great birria, and I'm going to put some of that on each one of these tortillas. Now, the classic accompaniments for this are onions and cilantro. I know that sounds absolutely basic, but I will tell you there is nothing better than to make sure you use a white onion, not a yellow onion for this, because it's going to give you that crisp texture and that really light flavor. Now, you could use Mexican hot sauce for this, like Tamazula or Valentina if you want, but a homemade salsa that is made with garlic, roasted garlic especially, and arbol chilies is really my go-to for birria tacos. So I will put a little of that on the top of it. So I'm leaving these on here long enough that I can crisp them lightly underneath, so that should be the right amount of time there, and then just fold them over, and I am going to flip them here so that I can get a little bit more color on them. I'm going to move that one up there. Ah, this is looking great. Okay, so you see a little bit of browning coming on these guys here. Yeah, they're beautiful. Just get a light crispness. Now, we're not going for all the way crisp here at all. That also helps when you dunk them into the birria broth. I'll put these guys over here. We have our seasoned broth to serve alongside them. So I'll do that. Of course, you're going to want some limes to go with this because against the richness of that meat, you're going to love having the tanginess of the lime. I always like to put a little bit of finishing salt on these guys right before serving, so a little Maldon salt is my choice for that, but any kind of salt, of course, will work. And then the moment has arrived. So you take the little slightly crisping taco. Ah, I missed that lime, and I'm not going to miss that here. That's going to be absolutely necessary. So squeeze that over the top, and then dip it in like that. That's heaven.

Fish tacos. I think that when you say the words fish tacos, everybody's mouths start to water and they start to think about something that's not just delicious, but might remind them of being near a big ocean body of water. I know that's what it does for me. Now, I know there are tons of different approaches to fish tacos and there are people who say that fish tacos should be only grilled fish, but I'm going to take you away from all of that and go back to the source because the source of fish tacos in Mexico is in Ensenada. And most people track it back to the fish market that's there, the one that's called Mercado Negro, that all these stalls popped up around and most people say that it was one man who started making these fish tacos at one of those stalls and everybody flocked to him and well, the next thing you know Ensenada is known as the fish taco capital of the world. At least I think it is. I think it's the place where you find the absolute best version. So I went there. I talked to everybody that I could talk to. I talked to the fishermen. I talked to the people who are making the fish tacos every day for the customers that came into their places and I've put together what I think is a great representation of the classic Ensenada fish taco. So let's start with the batter because these are battered and fried which is one of the things that makes them just so absolutely delicious. But it's not just a sort of tempura batter. It's a flavored batter and there's a lot of different approaches to them but they all sort of overlap at one place. They all start with flour and I'm going to add a little bit of baking powder to that because it does give you a very crisp light exterior. So I'll put in my teaspoon of baking powder there and then I'm going to distribute it nicely through the flour just by using a whisk to get those combined. And then we'll use that whisk to make the wet part of things here. So we are working with all-purpose flour here. If you want to make this a little bit lighter you can use cake flour for it. And you will notice a little bit of difference but I personally like it made with all-purpose flour the best because you've got all these condiments and the sliced cabbage that we'll be talking about in a minute. And so I think a little bit more substantial crust is a really good thing. But if you like really light use the cake flour for it. Now what we're going to use for liquid in this situation is going to be beer for me but I will tell you a lot of people in Ensenada do not use beer. They use water and it works perfectly well with water. You can use straight water. You can use sparkling water for an even lighter crisper crust, but I like the flavor of the beer in there and you've got the bubbles which is going to make for that really light crust. So I'm going to put that into this bowl here and now we got to talk about all the flavorings that go in here. I will tell you that the most common things that people will tell you to put in here are chicken bouillon. Okay, that's going to make it super savory and this kind of mustard what we would call like ballpark mustard here and I will say that that stuff is going to do two things. It's going to give a very light tanginess to it. But what it's really going to do is give us this beautiful color that I always associate with those classic ones. So I'm just going to take a teaspoon of this mustard out of here and put that into the beer. Toss that around to get most of it out of there. Okay, next the bouillon. Okay, so anybody that has been in any Mexican grandma's house has probably seen this packet nor suiza caldo de pollo in little cubes and people throw it into all kinds of things. Basically, when you look at the list of ingredients, it's a combination of salt and monosodium glutamate. Okay, so it's sort of taking a page out of the playbook of a lot of Asian recipes where they will add some monosodium glutamate to it. That's kind of what this does. Of course, there's flavorings in there that add that chicken flavor. You can find it in the cubes and crush those or you can find a powder version of that. Or if you're looking for something that's a more natural ingredient, I have had really good luck with this Orrington Farms. It doesn't have any MSG in it at all and it's a really beautiful chicken flavor. So you could use that one. So there's lots of options there. So I've got that one of those little nor suiza caldo de pollo cubes crushed up here and I'm going to put that into the liquid and then I'm going to follow that with some salt black pepper and Mexican oregano. Now I like to put the black pepper and the oregano in here because I think it just adds more savory qualities to this. But not everybody does that. The last thing that I'm going to do for flavor here is to slice up some garlic. And of course some of the people that I talked to said that they wouldn't use fresh garlic. They would use garlic powder. Garlic powder is a strong flavor that I don't care for very much. So I always use the fresh garlic when I can. What I'm going to suggest that you do with this if you're going to use fresh garlic to get it into the full flavor of it into the this batter is to put some salt on it maybe chop it as fine as you can and then use the side of your knife to mash this into a rough paste. It won't be a full paste. You don't have to go that far with it, but just to crush all of that good garlic flavor and get it distributed beautifully through the batter just use the side of your knife like this and just go down on it and keep pressing it and working it back and forth. The salt works as an abrasive there. So you'll just press it until you get a paste out of it. Okay, that looks pretty good to me. I see that a lot of the juices come out of the garlic and just scrape that up and I'm going to put that in to the liquid ingredients and then whisk that to make sure that everything that needs to dissolve does dissolve in there and then we'll put our dry ingredients the flour and the baking powder in there and I will tell you that this is way better if we let it sit for 20 minutes for the flour to absorb all of the moisture that it can absorb. So while we're putting that off to the side here let's talk a little bit about the fish and then about the frying. Then when that has sat for 20 minutes we'll come back and fry that fish. But first on to the fish itself here. So you need little pieces about three inches long about a half an inch on the sides but you can notice that mine are not all perfect and you'll never get perfect ones out of any kind of fish because of the nature of the the body of the fish. What I'm working with here is cod and it works absolutely beautifully for this kind of a preparation but it's certainly not the only fish that you could use. This is cod when I was in Ensenada. People used one of two fish usually. They would either use this little what's called a dogfish shark called casson but I wouldn't ever recommend using that only because it's moving its way into being an endangered species. So I don't recommend that but there is another kind of sea bass that they use a lot there that's just called pescado blanco. It's a large sea bass and cutting that into strips like this is absolutely perfect but that's not what you're going to find in your fishmonger's place. So I would say cod or hake are really good. Those are typically used for fish and chips which this is a version of. And then if you are looking for something really inexpensive I'm not a big tilapia fan but if you pick the thickest tilapia it will work beautifully for this and I've actually used it for this before and it's worked great. But then the more expensive fish the things like the mahi-mahi is just excellent in something like this. Catfish works really good and that's another inexpensive choice but what you want to do is to make the pieces as regular as possible just so that they will all cook in about the same amount of time. But don't fuss over it too much because you'll never have them all be exactly perfect. Now for the frying part of this and I know that this is where a lot of people stumble. This is sort of an air fryer kind of thing. You got to work with a pot of oil and I'm going to give you two choices here. Now this is a cast iron pan and it's about four inches deep. You can find this. This one is made by Lodge and I've had this one for 40 years. It's one of my very favorite pieces of cooking equipment. They're inexpensive and it's called a chicken fryer usually when you find it listed. It will because it's cast iron it will cook it will because it's cast iron it will hold heat very well which means that the temperature of the oil will stay the as as consistent as possible in this kind of a thing. But if you're really into frying things and I know a lot of you are then my recommendation is that you invest in a piece of equipment that is a regular fryer. Now this is a small commercial one made by Cecil Ware. You can find a wearing version of this as well and basically what you're working with here is a big pot of oil. This one's got the plastic wrap on the top of it because once I finish using this I will cool down the oil take it out in this container and put it in a refrigerator the back of a refrigerator where I know I'm not going to get to it for a while. Refrigerated used oil is the only way to go because once you've used your oil it could turn rancid. Now this is a there's a piece of equipment that has a fair amount of power to it and so it has an electric coil that runs through the oil and that's going to keep it at the most steady temperature. So if you're into frying things and you always fussing with what's going on at the on the stovetop because the temperatures go up and down too much then I would highly recommend getting one of this. You set it on 375 degrees and it will stay at 375 degrees because you have a good amount of oil and a consistent heat source running through it. Now I want this to get to 375 degrees but the only way I'm really going to know whether it's at 375 or not is to have a thermometer and I'm using this Therm Pro. I have had it for a long time. I like it very much. To me it's a very reliable it's a reliable piece of equipment and it really does tell me when when the temperature where the temperature is so that I can put it in at the right temperature but it also tells me then has it dropped way far down have I put too much in here and cooled my oil off. This is a piece of equipment that I recommend for everybody. Buying a thermometer that you can put in here. I have the probe stuck on the side here. It's got this long heat resistant cable to it so I can also use it as an oven thermometer if I want to but all of this is really important for making the best fish tacos. I'll come back when that batter is ready. Now we've got the fish cut, the batter rested and the oil at 375 degrees so pick a piece up with a pair of tongs and then you want to get most of it off of there so let it dangle for a minute there and then I like to put it in here and kind of turn it a little bit and then let go of it so that it doesn't just sink to the bottom and stick to the bottom of the pot and I'll put about five or six pieces in here and there we go. Now what I'm looking for here is an uncrowded layer. I put five pieces in there. I probably could have gotten six of them in there but I want these to float freely so that they cook evenly and I don't want to drop the temperature too much. Now what I've noticed is that I've dropped now to about 345 here. I'm going to turn the temperature up underneath this so that I can recover that getting it back to that 375 as quickly as I possibly can. Keep turning these guys and when they're a deep golden brown it takes about four minutes or so to cook these guys but most of the fish that I was talking about that is perfect for this can be well cooked fully cooked and still be really delicious. Okay I think we're about where we need to be with this. They will be a beautiful golden brown here like that. Take those out and drain them on paper towels when they're all beautifully golden. Then wait for the oil to go back to 375 degrees and continue frying. I'm going to transfer these fried ones after they've drained on the paper towel for a minute or two onto a wire rack and I've got my oven on low here and I'm just going to keep them warm in the low oven until we get everything fried. Now on to the classic garnishes that go on to tacos de pescado and ensenada. Now at first I think it was probably just a pico de gallo kind of salsa that was put on them but one of my favorite parts that has become traditional over probably the last 30-40 years is what I call baja crema. So it does start with crema Mexican style crema. You could use sour cream or creme fraiche for this and then you add to that some mayonnaise. I will say that for me that combination of that slightly sour flavor of the of the cream and the richness of the cream with the flavors and the textures of the mayonnaise is just spectacular. So I've got a third of a cup of each one of those and then we're going to just mix them together and add enough milk so that this mixture would be easily spoonable. So back to that sort of loose crema consistency. I've got a little milk here so I'll put that in there. I think this is really benefits a lot from just a pinch of salt since there's no salt in the crema and this is going to be one of our condiments here. Now the other ingredient that we're going to go on to here is the cabbage part of it. Lots of people in Baja use red cabbage for it but I don't like the the density of red cabbage a lot so my choice but it may not be yours is to use Napa cabbage. So I've got some sliced up and you want to slice it thin some sliced up Napa cabbage here for a salsa. Of course you could do that pico de gallo and lots of people really love that or you could do the other thing that I find in all of the places that sell these fish tacos in Ensenada and that is a red chili sauce. Now red chili sauce you could do just by buying a Mexican hot sauce if you want to or as I've done in other videos a dried chili sauce that just has garlic and a touch of vinegar to it. That's what I'm going to do here and to me the absolute perfect fish taco has that really bitey red chili sauce on it because it's such a beautiful combination with the crema the Baja crema. So we've got our fish all nicely fried here. I'm going to put a couple of warm tortillas down. Now a pound of fish should make about 18 pieces. So if you have small tortillas then you could probably make 18 little tacos out of it. I've got small ones here but if you have larger tortillas you may just want to kind of break some of these in half but I'm going to put one of these beauties on each one here. The next thing that I like to put on there is the crema so I will drizzle some of that across the top here on each of these and then I like to put the red chili salsa on top of that just like that and that gives you that really bold flavor. Then the last little bit here will be that crunchy raw cabbage. You always want to serve these with a lime wedge to go alongside each one and there you have what I think at least for me is the absolute perfect taco de pescado in the style that you find them in Ensenada and I'm ready for a bite."}, {"title": "Cheesy Roasted Poblano Tacos | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-3XPUvi5YCw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBFFlHHkQ7wr8fwGfO5WG2Jf5zZdg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3XPUvi5YCw&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=7&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us sort of to queso fundido. Now the translation for queso fundido is just melted cheese, and it's a specialty that you'll find in a lot of the northern Mexican restaurants, especially the ones that serve that beautiful roasted goat called cabrito, and they will make little earthenware pots of melted cheese. They serve it on the table. You scoop it up. Well, I will say you scoop it into tortillas and make tacos out of it, so that's why we're kind of doing a queso fundido taco, but I find a lot of people have trouble with it because the cheese cools off too fast, and then it's really hard to make tacos out of, and it's just not very good. So I'm going to show you what I call my roasted poblano queso fundido inspired by a taqueria near our apartment in Mexico City at a place called Los Parados, and they actually stuffed cheese directly into poblanos like this and put it on a wood-burning grill and turn it until the exterior is nicely charred, and the soft cheese on the inside can be kind of chopped up with it, and then they make tacos, okay? So I'm going to show you the way that you could do that. If you're going to have four or five people around and you want to make these cheesy roasted poblano tacos, a kind of version of queso fundido. First thing you got to do is roast the poblanos because we're going to get these guys done ahead of time. I've put them on a rimmed baking sheet here, and I've got my broiler on high. I've got the shelf the highest position that it can be in here, and I'm going to slide these guys in. I am going to let them roast for a few minutes until they start to blacken on the top, and then I'll go in there and turn them a little bit at a time until they're blackened all over. When the poblanos have cooled off enough that you can handle them, then just rub off all that blackened skin. Then open them up so that you can pull out the seed pod, and the stem will just come right with it. Then kind of get rid of as many of those seeds as possible, and then quickly rinse them off so that you get rid of stray bits of skin and stray seeds. Then chop them into small pieces, about a quarter of an inch each. Okay, I'm finished with the preparations now here. I've got the roasted, peeled, and diced chiles poblanos. I've got some shredded cheese. I encourage you not to buy shredded cheese. It all has cellulose on the outside, and it doesn't melt particularly well. I've got some salsa, and hopefully, I've got some friends around that are going to help me eat this because once we get to this stage, we want to have everybody gathered because this doesn't take any time at all. I'm going to scrape the poblanos into this skillet that I have heated over kind of a medium heat, spread them out. My heat, I want to get my heat exactly right here. I'm going to shake them around a little bit in this skillet. You could stir it if that's an easier way for you to do it. This is just to warm them at this point because once they get warm, when they're steaming, and I can see these are starting to steam now, I'm going to start stirring in this cheese and melting it in with it. This is a really fun thing to do when you've got friends around, especially if they're just hanging out in the kitchen with you because they'll see this thing coming together, and it will make them really, really happy. Okay, so I've put a big handful of cheese in with our steaming poblanos. I think it's easiest to do this in a non-stick skillet if you have one. It's certainly not a deal breaker if you don't. I'm going to put another big handful of cheese in here because that one is almost melted, and then I'll stir this around as it melts in. Usually there's enough salt in cheese that you don't have to do any seasonings for this. See, it's already just making my mouth water here. And then the last, we've got that melted. The last addition of the cheese here, stir that in, and we are ready to serve. So you can see how fast this comes in, and of course there's nothing that is more attractive to most people than stringy, gooey, melted cheese. Okay, you can see it's just chock full of those poblano chilies. So we'll take this off. Keep it in the skillet. I say serve it from the skillet because anything that you do at this point to transfer it out of here will start to cool it down, and then of course the cheese will begin to set up. I keep stirring it here because the edges have gotten quite hot, and I don't want them, I don't want the cheese to break at all there. Okay, so let me show you what a couple of these cheesy roasted poblano tacos will look like here. I'm going to lay a couple of warm tortillas out here. I'm going to pull that closer to me because, yeah, this is, just look at it. It's so pretty. So I suggest that you make tacos for your guests, spoon out the gooey goodness like that. I like to put just a spoonful of roasted tomatillo salsa on it because it's tangy and it will contrast the richness of the cheese. If you have it, I would suggest a few leaves of cilantro because it'll add a beautiful freshness to your tacos. And there you have it, something that's kind of good looking."}, {"title": "Bold Red Chile Salsa | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y4g2DO_CFBU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCSns60IveNFtzNMRJMUMkJFWCRPw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4g2DO_CFBU&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=8&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "We're on to one of my favorite essential salsas, the one that's really spicy and red chili forward. It can be made with all Arbol chilies, but today I'm going to mix Arbol chilies with a few Guajillo chilies. It's still going to be really spicy, but the Guajillo chilies sort of tame it just a tiny little bit. We're going to start with half an ounce of each one, and if you don't have a scale, that's going to be about 25 of these Arbol chilies. Now you might find the Arbol chilies that you buy have the long stems on them. Please break those off before we start this toasting process. But I'm going to throw these guys into a hot skillet. I have this over about medium heat here, and they are going to start toasting while I take the stems off of these guys and then open them up and shake out the seeds. Now Guajillo chilies could be replaced with New Mexico chilies if that would be easier for you. But there's a lot of other kinds of chilies that might be welcome here like cascabel or morita if you're looking for something that's a little smoky. I'm watching my chilies that are heating up next to me because as soon as I see the slightest little whiff of smoke on them, I know I'm going to start turning them and turning them so that they don't burn in any one place here, but I'm going to, I think, just be right at the time here of taking the seeds out of these Guajillo chilies. Always take the veins out as well. That's like the veins that you'll see in there. Okay, so we don't have to be too meticulous about the seeds here. Now I'm using my nose here to guide me, but also the visuals of some dark spots on these. We don't want to over toast them because that will make the salsa bitter here. So I'm going to just scrape these out right now and put them into a bowl while we toast the other, turn that up just a touch there, while we toast these Guajillos. So lay them, I usually start by laying them the inside down using my spatula here to press them flat against the hot surface. And you'll notice here that if, when they're toasted, not only will you smell them, but when you turn them over, they'll start to lighten in places. So this is not quite all lightened all over, so I haven't toasted it quite enough. So we'll press a little bit more on these guys. Let's take a look at this guy over here. See how it's lightened up all the way through. That's what I'm looking for. You don't have to have a very, like dark spots on these guys at all. We're going to put these now, since they're toasted, in with the Arbol chilies, and I'm going to cover them with hot tap water. Now because these chilies will float, I usually take a small plate and just lay them on top, lay it on top there, and we're going to let those soak for a few minutes until they become more pliable. And during that soaking time, I'm going to roast this garlic. These are unpeeled garlic cloves. I've got six of them here that are good size. I want a good garlic flavor in this. And we're going to turn them over about the medium heat here for about 10 to 15 minutes until they will have little dark spots on them, but they'll be very soft. You'll be able to twist them between your fingers. The garlic has cooled off a little bit after it has roasted completely, and I'm peeling the little papery skins off of it. That's an easy thing to do once they have been roasted, because the papery skin, if you just twist them between your fingers, will dislodge that. So there we go. If you start down at the root end, it's way easier. And then my last one, and you can see how I said that they'll just twist between your fingers, and that not only gets the papery skin off, but it also proves to you that they're very soft. That gives them a sweet flavor. Now they're going to go into the blender jar here with the soaked chilies. I'm going to give the water a taste, and I always recommend that you do this, because if this water tastes really bitter, then I would replace it with regular water. This one doesn't. So I'm going to pour a cup full of this water into the blender jar, turn this on, and make a smooth puree. Now don't get right over the top of this, because all of that capsaicin, the hot part of it, is volatile into the air, so stay your distance or you'll start choking. Our red chili salsa goes into a serving dish. I'm going to season this with about a tablespoon of vinegar. You may want a little bit more, but it just makes it really bright, and stir that in along with about a half a teaspoon of salt. Now remember, salsas should have a nice amount of salt, because they are a seasoning thing. So I put just a little bit more than that half of a teaspoon there. And I'm going to give this a little taste, and wow, it's so bold, it's so bright. I don't know about you, but this is, for me, one of the absolute quintessential flavors of the Mexican taqueria."}, {"title": "Salsa de Molcajete | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bC85E00qgVs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCuQ_V7MXssk5IrVvEy_40sbv4RnQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC85E00qgVs&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=9&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "One of my favorite of my desert island salsas would be the Salsa de Molcajete. So what does that mean, Salsa de Molcajete? It is a roasted tomato salsa where you crush stuff in a mortar. So don't click this off if you don't have a mortar. I'm going to show you how to use a mortar, but you can also use a food processor or a blender to achieve really good results. But if you have a mortar, man, the flavors and the texture really blossom. Okay, so how do you make this roasted tomato salsa? Let's start with the tomatoes here. You want the ripest tomatoes that you can find. They should be red all the way through. I'm going to put them on a rimmed baking sheet because I'm going to do this under the broiler. The recipe that I'm going to attach with this video will also have the very traditional stovetop roasting that is very common throughout Mexico. I've got one serrano chili, or you could use a jalapeno. I find the serranos have more uniform heat. Sometimes the jalapenos don't have any heat. And for me, this salsa with one is great. You may like it more with two. I've got three large cloves of garlic here, but they're still in their papery husks. I'll lay those there. And then I've got two slices of white onion, and I'm going to lay those right over here. And because I'm doing this under a broiler, I've already preheated the broiler. I've already put the shelf in at that very highest. And I'm going to slide this in. It usually takes about six minutes or so for all of this stuff to start getting dark. And we really want it to be sort of blackened in places. And then I'll go in there and turn everything over. In the second six minutes, you really have to watch the garlic and the chili because they may be done way earlier than the onion and the tomatoes, but I'll show you what they all look like. I'm just going to slide this in here, and I will meet you back here when they are ready. Okay, let's take a look at all of this here. So we've got the tomatoes. Their skin should come right off. It'll be a little hot. You probably want to wait until these are cooled down some, but you see how easy the skin comes off. You don't feel like you have to get 100% of the skin off of these guys, but you might want a little of that char. Some people like that. Now this garlic is the next thing that we have to peel, and it's going to be easy to peel just like those tomatoes were. Just peel that papery skin right off. The clove shrinks away from the skin. So we've got those guys there. Now this is our Serrano chili, and I want to get the stem off of it, and we're going to go to work with this crushing in the mortar. Now if you don't have a mortar, you're going to do this in a food processor. It's a little harder to do it in a blender because this is just sort of dry-ish stuff. You don't have much liquid. And then this is what you're going to do if you've got a mortar. Now you might have a mortar that is made out of granite or marble. It'll work fine. I'm using the classic Mexican mortar that is made out of basalt, a type of lava rock, and you see how incredibly easy it is to make almost a puree out of the garlic and green chili there. Now one of the reasons that I always encourage everybody to do this is because the smell is just amazing on it. Roasted garlic, roasted green chili is one of the greatest things that has ever been cooked and mashed together. Okay, we've got now, and here you're really working rock against rock. So you're really, usually most people in Mexico will hold this part of the mortar like that so that they can really work whatever it is that they're working together in the mortar. Okay, so we've got that done there. Now with our tomatoes here, I usually like to chop them into smaller pieces. It just makes this next step go way easier. So we'll do these guys one at a time, again, using that same crushing rock against rock. Some people like to use the Roma style tomatoes for this. It makes a little bit thicker, textured salsa. I think all tomatoes have their place. I'm just going to keep putting these in here and crushing them until I get them all done. This is looking and smelling really beautiful. Last thing that we have of the ingredients that are roasted, the last ones we have to put in here are the onions. So I like to just chop it into small pieces. Some people would use a raw onion for this, but I'm really into these all-roasted flavors. And I think that the texture goes better in this roasted tomato salsa. So let's work on that. So line those up so I can chop the pieces really small. You want to start with about a quarter of an inch thick piece here. And we'll scoop that into the salsa. Now, if you had used the Roma tomatoes for this, they would be considerably thicker than what we're going to experience here. So we'll stir those roasted onions in here. This is the point at which you have to decide if it's the right consistency. I'm using round tomatoes and they're juicier, so I've got a really nice consistency here. I've got a few juices from the tomatoes that are still on that baking sheet. So I'll get those in there and just stir them. But this is the right consistency for me. But if yours is thicker than this, you'll want to take a little bit of water to it. Okay, next thing that we're going to do is to taste it and give it some salt. Okay. I know kind of where I am. I'm going to say that this is going to take a scant teaspoon of salt because, remember, salsa is a seasoning, so you season it highly. So I will take about that much and stir that in. And then I'm going to give it another taste just to see how we are with the salt level and then judge acidity. Do we want it to be more acid? Because if we do, we can use some lime juice or some vinegar in this. Vinegar is pretty common. It seems just a tiny bit flat to me. So I'm going to squeeze just a little bit of lime juice in here because I think that will perk it up. Remember, you're going for slightly salty, bold flavors. So this acid is going to be the right thing for that. And then we have one more ingredient that we can add or we don't have to add, and that would be cilantro in this. And then we'll give it one final taste because I say making a salsa like this, it could make or break your meal. So you really do want to pay close attention to all of the seasoning. So I'm just bunching up that cilantro there and giving it a very fine slice. And I don't want too much. I want it to be quite finely chopped, so the flavor of it is distributed all through here. But that should do the right amount for this, at least for my taste. You might like more or less. Scoop all of that in there. One final taste here. And you're going to have what I consider to be sort of the queen of the salsas."}, {"title": "Tacos al Pastor | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GS7g2l6t_Ug/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBsNauMJRcDn6RG60DGLh5pDxV6fA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS7g2l6t_Ug&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=10&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "The next page in our taco manual takes us to the iconic tacos al pastor. I know you've all seen them. They're done on a vertical spit with layers of marinated pork. They're charred on the outside. That charred pork is sliced off and made into tacos. Well that is beyond what most people could even think about doing in their home. So I'm going to show you the easiest way to get to the flavor of tacos al pastor at home. And the first thing that we have to do is to make a special variation on the red chili adobo marinade that is so common in Mexico. And I'm going to show you two different ways in. If you are really comfortable with ancho chiles, the dried ancho chiles, then I suggest you start with that because it'll give you the lightest and brightest flavor. Of course when you're working with ancho chiles, you have to open them up, pull out the stem end of it, dump the seeds out. And these should be quite pliable. If yours are not pliable, it means that they're a little old and they won't have as much flavor. And then you just tear your chile ancho into flat pieces. I've got five of them already done over here. I'll clean up the board here and we'll continue on because we need to toast and soak these guys. So it's adding another step in the process of making this. If you want to avoid all of this, then I'm going to ask you to work with ancho powder. This is about a half a cup or two ounces of the ancho powder. I'm going to show you how to work with that too. But before we finish, before we get to the place where we can actually soak this, I'm going to just lay some of these ancho chiles into an ungreased skillet. It's just a dry skillet here. Use a spatula, like a metal spatula here, to press them down and start toasting them. So we're doing this over about a medium heat here. And it'll take about a minute or so. Sometimes if your pan is quite hot, it'll take less time than that. But I'm using my nose to detect this beautiful, toasty, dried chili aroma. But I'm also using my eyes to see when they're ready here. So as I press these down, on the inside they will turn to a lighter color like that. That says that they're toasted. But they should smell beautifully aromatic at this point. Okay, so there's one batch of them there. And I've got one more batch before we cover them with hot tap water. So I'm going to lay these guys right in here and then press them. The pan, again, is medium hot. You don't want to get it too hot or they will blister. But the pan has gotten a little bit hotter recently here, so this toasting is going to go faster than our initial one did. I can smell that beautiful toasted chili aroma. Scoop them in. I'm going to take them to the sink and do hot tap water on them. And then once they're covered, I'll just put a small plate there, press it down to keep them submerged so that they will evenly rehydrate. Now, if you're using the ancho powder here, now this is not chili powder, okay? Chili powder has salt and sugar and spices and so forth in it. And so I'm going to rehydrate this pure chili powder very quickly with a cup and a quarter of boiling water. So there we've got our cup and a quarter. I'm going to put it into this blender jar here and then the water. Put the top on that and then I'm going to put the top on, but I'm going to release this central plug in the middle here because you don't want to trap all that hot steam in there. It'll blow the top right off. So then I just put a towel over the top and blend it just to mix. It doesn't take much time. Now, while that is cooling off some, while our chili pods are roasting here, I'm going to also roast some garlic. I have eight nice-looking dientes de ajo, as they would say in Spanish, cloves of garlic, and I'm putting it in the same pan, ungreased, over medium heat. And I'm going to turn these for, it'll take around 15 minutes. All this will come out at the same time, basically, but I want these to be completely soft on the inside. They will have a little black blotchiness on the outside, but that's what we're looking for, is that beautiful roasted flavor. Garlic is roasted. I have rehydrated the ancho chiles. We've got our chile powder that has been reconstituted with boiling water, cooled down now, but I'm going to show you this last step with the chili pods. I'm going to put these guys in here with a little bit of their soaking liquid. Looks like it's about half of their soaking liquid there. And then we're going to make a puree out of these guys. So put those back up here on the blender, and we will start that, and we're going to let this go until it is as smooth a puree as we can get it. This has stalled a little bit. It's not going through the blades, so I'm going to put a little bit more of our soaking liquid in there, and then continue to blend until it gets really smooth. So there you have it, the reconstituted powdered ancho chile, or the reconstituted and blended chile puree from the chile pods. Now I'm going to choose to just work with one of these bases that we've created here, and I'm going to work with the one that's made from the chile pods, and we're going to turn that into the really classic red chile adobo that's used for marinades on all kinds of things in Mexico. That always has a variety of spices in it. I have here a quarter teaspoon of cumin and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper, a whole teaspoon of Mexican oregano. I'm just going to dump all of that together here and give it a very quick crush. This is the molcajete. I love having a small molcajete. You can't really make salsa in it, but it's great for grinding dried spices like this. It's kind of too small for salsa, so I like to use it for grinding these kinds of things. Okay, so I think I'm pretty well done there. I'm going to use a little brush. I always keep beside this so that I can scrape everything in here. We have a half a teaspoon now of Mexican cinnamon. I usually grind that in an electric spice grinder, and then I keep a little half jar of it ground at all times. So I'm going to put the half teaspoon of that in there. So those are our four spices that go in there, and then I'm going to add to that a quarter of a cup of vinegar. I'm using apple cider vinegar. You could use any kind of vinegar really that you want for this. We're just looking for some nice acidity, and then I'm going to add a couple of teaspoons of salt to it. Remember, this is a marinade, so it's heavily seasoned. And we're going to blend that, and that will give us now the classic red chili adobo. Except, of course, I forgot all of the roasted garlic. So we got to throw the roasted garlic in there. I've peeled it. I left one to show you. Once it's cooled down, the peel will come right off of it like that. That papery skin will come right off of it. So we'll put that in there, and then I have noticed also that some of my black pepper looks like it didn't want to go down in there. So I'm going to just scrape it down in there, and then put the top on, and again, blend it until it's as smooth as I can get it. Now, if you have a high-speed blender, this will look velvety. If you have a regular, standard-issue kind of blender, you might notice some of the chili skins in there. I would push it through a sort of medium-mesh sieve just to catch those skins and give it that really velvety texture, but I don't really have to do that with this. Okay, so I'm going to take half of this. Okay, so I am coming to right around two cups there. So I'm going to take about a cup of it out of this blender jar. I think I've got that about right there, and we're going to turn this other half of it now into a very special adobo that is for making the tacos al pastor, and that changes in a couple of ways. One is that if you're like in Mexico City, a lot of people will, you can just use this one the way that it is, but a lot of people would put a little bit of achiote. When you go to the Mexican grocery store, this is the achiote package that you're going to be looking for. So we've got about a half of one of those containers, and I'm just going to break it up and put it in here. You'll notice that it's a very, it dyes food really, and your fingers really, a lot. So I tear that up and I put that in there. I'm going to want just about a tablespoon, I like to put this in there, about a tablespoon of agave syrup. You could use corn syrup, you could use honey for this, but this will make the marinade brown the meat a little bit better. So I like to put about a tablespoon of it in there, but I'm not sure I got a tablespoon, so I'm going to just do a little bit more there. And then the last unusual ingredient for this, well I could say a not so unusual ingredient that we're going to use for this, is to put a quarter of a cup of oil. You could use regular vegetable oil. I'm using some good olive oil because I like the flavor of it in this. But the last thing is going to be our pineapple. Pineapple is a part of tacos al pastor everywhere. I like to put a little bit of it in the marinade when we're working with this red chili adobo, this classic red chili adobo. Customize it for tacos al pastor by blending in a little bit of pineapple as well. So I'm going to take the top and bottom off of this pineapple and cut it now into quarters. And then we're going to use about a quarter of this for making this preparation. Not all of it for the adobo, most of it not for the adobo. I like to cut the core out like that. And when you go to the places where they have the beautiful field ripened pineapples, you will notice that their cores are very very tender. But most of what we get in the United States is not. The cores are not tender at all. I don't cut a whole lot of the edge off of this. A lot of people cut real deeply into it, but I do it sort of a light one. And then I go back and cut the little eyes out of here. So you can just use the tip of a knife to kind of go down in there and cut those guys out. Okay, clean up our little mess here. And then one slice off of this here is going to go into the adobo. We're ready to blend this again until it is all incorporated. This piece we are going to cut in half inch slices. And then we will grill or pan sear that along with the pork. That brings us to the pork. This is pork shoulder roast. So I have about a pound and a half of it. And I'm going to slice this. If you don't feel comfortable slicing, you can usually buy thin pork steaks also cut from the same pork shoulder. So it'd be a pork shoulder steak. You could buy something like that. And then it's probably going to be too thick and you're probably going to need to pound it a little bit to get it a little bit thinner. So you're trading off one thing for another. I'm going to cut mine up here. Just take it off of that. And I'm going to cut crosswise strips that are about they're going to look sort of like short pieces of bacon. And they're going to be about a quarter of an inch thick. Okay, that's all done. I'll just move this to the side here. I had it a little piece of damp paper towel there just to keep that flexible cutting board in place. And we'll put this here. And we're going to lay these guys out tightly and then brush them with our special marinade on both sides. Okay, now at home, you can finish your al pastor taco meat in two ways. You could finish it either on the grill, which is my preferred way of doing it or in a hot skillet. I'm going to show you both ways. So grill or heavy skillet, I got my 12 inch cast iron skillet. I actually sitting here over this grill, pretend it's on a burner in the house. But I just wanted to show you this sort of side by side here. The first thing that I'm going to do is to spray about half of the meat because I'm going to cook half of it on the grill with some oil and put a little coating, a light coating of oil in this hot skillet here. That's for the second half of the meat. And I am going to the stuff that I didn't grill. I mean, I didn't spray with oil. I'm just going to lay here in this pan. The other part of it will go on the grill and we will grill it doesn't take very long for any of this. That looks so beautiful. It smells so beautiful. I wish you could smell it now with the pineapple here. I put it all in the skillet because this was ready first. So you can sear your pineapple in the skillet if you want, or you could grill it. If you're going to grill it, then my suggestion is that you lightly spray it with oil before you put it on the grill. But you can see they're gorgeous seared ones here in this skillet. Now I'm working with a hot grill and a hot pan. Okay. That's really essential. If you want to get this beautiful end result that will just make everybody's mouth water. Now let's go on to the making of the tacos. This is what I'm sure all of you have been waiting for. I know it's what I have been waiting for. So I'm going to cut up some of the meat. I like to just cut crosswise, leaving it in slightly longer pieces. Of course, when you eat it in Mexico, it's usually in slightly smaller pieces than this, at least lengthwise. If you want to, you could run your knife down like that. I'll take one of these pieces of seared pineapple, cut that crosswise, and then into small pieces. We've got some onions and cilantro here. A chopped white onion that has been rinsed and then mixed with chopped cilantro. Warm corn tortillas, of course, which are a must for these beautiful al pastor style tacos, even though they're not done on the big spit. So we'll put the meat down like that. I did forget one thing here, which is not, which is critical, and that is that we do need to put a little bit of salt on this meat here. Top it off with some pineapple, which doesn't want to come up off of the board, like that. Seared pineapple is just so good. Now we'll put on that onion and cilantro, which is super classic in Mexico. I've got some chipotle salsa here to go over the top of it. And whether you like it or not, I'm not going to wait another minute. I'm going to have tacos al pastor."}, {"title": "Greens and Beans | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nKnK6kWL4k/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAIzu_SPRpIJ9a-DjhMAy-vK4-5ag", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nKnK6kWL4k&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=11&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Hello everyone and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to a regional recipe for beans and greens in a red chili sauce. So we're headed in a vegetable direction and for this recipe I've kind of put two things together. It's a famous dish called shoneki in the state of Veracruz, which is beans and greens in a red chili sauce, but it's not done as a taco filling. It's served in hearty bowls. In the central part of Mexico there are lots of people that make tacos out of greens, just greens. So I've kind of pulled those two recipes together to give you the best of the Veracruz beans and greens and the best of what you will find from a lot of street vendors in central Mexico. So the first thing that we have to do is to make a chili sauce and this is a, if you're not really used to making red chili sauces, this is a great place to start because you're not working with a ton of chilies like you would be if you're going to be making a mole or something like that. So this is an ancho chili. It's the one that's got a sort of dark cranberry color to it. Make sure that they're always flexible when you buy them. If they're completely stiff, they will not have good flavor. I can tell you that. I always loosen the stem end and then just tear that off, open the chili up and let the seeds fall out. You don't have to be incredibly meticulous with this part of it. And then I just tear it into flat pieces. I've got three of them here and I'm going to toast them. Now this is an essential part of making a great chili sauce as far as I'm concerned. There are people who won't always toast these, but in a lot of New Mexico style chili sauces are made with untoasted chilies. But for me, it's like the difference in flavor between say a boiled carrot and a roasted carrot. I always want to go for the roasted carrots because I think they have so much more complexity and sweetness. Now I've got this big skillet. I'm going to do all this cooking in a 12 inch cast iron skillet and I'm pressing them down. I have it heated over medium heat here. I'm pressing them down until I smell them. Now if it's really hot, they'll begin to burn right away. I have this over a sort of medium heat, not very strong, but I'm smelling this toasty dried chili aroma. And when I see them start to bubble in places, flip over those pieces, press them down again. This shouldn't take more than a minute at most. Sometimes if it's a little bit hotter, they will take even less time than that. But use your nose as your guide. You want to smell that toasty dried chili smell. Okay, so now they're all ready here and I'm going to take them to rehydrate over to the sink here. And I have a small bowl sitting here. Turn on hot tap water. There's no need to boil water for this. Hot tap water is just fine. And when it is hot, then cover them generously with water, about two cups or so of water. And if they are all poking up because they're floating to the top, just lay a little plate on there and it'll keep them submerged. This will take about 20 minutes or so for these to rehydrate. And I'll meet you back here when they're ready. So take a look at these chilies. They look very different than the dried version of them. They're completely soft and reconstituted here with the water that we used to soak them. And I'm going to put those into a blender jar. Now the next thing that you need to do is to taste this. Sometimes anchovies will have bitterness to them. And so a little taste will tell you whether to use this or not. This one doesn't have bitterness. So I'm going to go ahead and use it for the blending and the thinning out of this sauce here. But let's get the rest of the ingredients together for it. So we're going to flavor this with three really classic ingredients, spices and herbs that go into it. We have cumin, black pepper, and Mexican oregano here. The cumin and black pepper, I'm simply going to pulverize in this small molcajete. So this is the kind of molcajete that I always have sitting out because I love the flavor of fresh ground spices here. And once I've got a powder out of these, and I also always keep a small brush on hand to brush out the molcajete. So we'll get those in there. And then we'll put in the Mexican oregano. That doesn't have to be ground up at all. It will pulverize nicely. We've got a couple cloves of peeled garlic here. And just roughly chop that so that it'll blend nicely with everything else. About a half a cup now of this soaking liquid. So we'll pour that in, into the blender jar. And if that's not quite enough to keep everything moving through the blades, then just add a little bit more of that soaking liquid. Here we go. Now I'm using a high-speed blender here. And it's very powerful and will chop up all of the skins of the chilies. But if you're using a less powerful blender, this next step, you may want to first strain all of this to collect any little seeds or bits of skin that didn't get thoroughly blended. Because the next step here is to cook this down until it's the consistency of tomato paste. So I'm going to first film the skillet, still over kind of a medium heat here, with enough oil just to coat the bottom. We'll take a couple of tablespoons there, tip that around just so that it's evenly done there. I want to make sure that it's hot. And that sizzle is what I'm looking for. So in goes all of this chili puree here. And then we're going to stir this for just a couple of minutes until it darkens in color and it reduces to the consistency of tomato paste. So just stand here and stir it. Now just look at what the consistency and color of that is. Now this is an absolutely essential step in creating the perfect flavor for a red chili sauce. What we are doing here is to bring out sweetness in it and to balance any astringency or raw flavor that you would have in that chili sauce. And it's a very quick cook, but it's at a fairly high temperature and you're reducing everything down and it just brings all the flavors perfectly together. We're going to add now to it a cup and a half, which is just exactly what I have there, of the soaking liquid. You could use water if your soaking liquid is, or chicken broth if you want to use that. But this was a nice sweet soaking liquid, so we're going to reinforce the chili flavor with that. I'm going to bring it to a simmer here and then we're going to season this guy with salt. It takes a little more than you would think for a red chili sauce, especially this one's going to have beans in it, so it's got to be fairly highly seasoned. So I'm going to put in a teaspoon and a half of salt. And I'm using here the diamond crystal salt. You know, it's a little bit fluffier in the spoon than say if you were to use a regular iodized salt. And now I'm going to taste what this is like again. Let me stir the sauce just to make sure that the salt has evenly distributed through it. And so now what I'm looking for is to make sure that it's nicely seasoned, which it is. I took that one and a half teaspoons of salt, but there's a lingering bitterness. So for that, because of that, I am going to put just a pinch, literally a big pinch of sugar in here, which will give me that really beautiful balance without making this sauce sweet, but it'll taste beautifully balanced. Now I don't get that sort of bitterness or astringency that I got the first taste of it. Now let's talk about the greens. If you were in Mexico, you would be choosing usually between three different greens. The ones that are called quelites, which we call lamb's quarters in English, the ones that are called quintoniles, which we call amaranth greens in the United States, or Swiss chard. Those are the three things that you will find in the markets usually. But the quelites and the quintoniles are usually not sold where you find the Swiss chard sold. Swiss chard is a European ingredient that's sold in the great big stalls of vegetables where you'll find the amaranth greens and the lamb's quarters sold by people who collect things in the wild. And that's what I'm always looking for because I love both of those flavors very, very much. You can find amaranth greens a lot of times in Asian grocery stores in the U.S., and you can find the lamb's quarters oftentimes at a farmer's market. We're to a rolling boil now. I am going to use one of my favorite greens of all time, and that is lacinato kale or black kale as oftentimes called. And I have just, you can see here, just pulled the bottom stem off. That's the thickest part of the stem. And then I'm going to cut crosswise here at about half-inch increments, and then put all of that. I've got eight cups. This is about one bunch, about an eight-ounce bunch, and it makes this sort of fluffy eight cups here. And I'm going to put these in here. If you're using the lamb's quarters or the amaranth greens, my suggestion to you is just simply take off the stem and cut them in about half-inch segments, and you'll be fine. Same thing with Swiss chard, and Swiss chard is very easily available in most grocery stores in the United States. Push it all down there. I don't have a top for my 12-inch skillet. Maybe you do. So I will put a sheet pan on the top of that, and we're going to let that cook for about eight minutes or so. That's about how long it will take to make that green tender. Everything is going to be, every green is going to be different. The lamb's quarters will take about as long as the lacinato kale. And I will say that the quintoniles will take less time, about five minutes or so. You could even do this with spinach if you want to, but boy, it'll just sort of come to a simmer. You'll let it go for a minute or so, and that's long enough to cook spinach. That cooks really, really fast. But I'll meet you back here when this lacinato kale is tender. All right, let's see what we got here. It's reduced a little bit. I'm going to stir it. Yeah, it's reduced a little bit, but the kale is feeling, to me, like it's really close to done. You might want to have this be a little bit crunchy because we've got a little bit more cooking to go here. Mmm. Oh, it's just right tender. Okay, last thing, two cans of black beans to go in here. You see that I'm doing it juice and all here. When I was younger, we used to always say that you always wanted to rinse the beans that came out of a can because they had a tinny flavor to them. But that's not the case anymore because the cans like this are coated with something that makes them very, it protects the food that's in there. So we'll stir those beans in with the greens, and now we're going to let this reduce until it holds its shape, just what you would expect to have for a taco filling. We don't want any runny taco fillings. Take a look at this. I wish you could smell it because it just smells so delicious, that red chili sauce. You get the smell of the sweetness of the beans, and then you can see all of the greens that are in there. This is about what I want it to be. If you take it much, much beyond this, then it'll start to be kind of pasty in the taco. So I've got some warm tortillas here, so I'll show you how we can build a couple of tacos here. So I'm just going to lay those out like that. Now this is going to be hot, so I'll put that down there and bring it closer over here. So take one spoonful of the mixture to go on there, and another one. And what I like to put on this, you could do it with hot sauce if you want to have a stronger red chili flavor here. I think it's got enough, but I like the contrast of queso fresco here. This is the homemade queso fresco that we do at our restaurant, but you can buy queso fresco at your Mexican grocery stores or a well-stocked grocery store, but another version of a fresh cheese could be delicious here too. You could do goat cheese or maybe some feta crumbles. Those are fresh cheeses that will be absolutely delicious on this. It's a homey flavor. Certainly if you're looking for more meatless things to make at home, this is incredibly satisfying, so I encourage you to make the red chili beans and greens into tacos."}, {"title": "Carne Deshebrada | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J6CuuNPS78w/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDE-PhM2Yyv__rtC4J50TU-afUqzQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6CuuNPS78w&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=12&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Hi everybody and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is going to take us to a beloved regional specialty. Now it's called carne deshebrada or just sort of unadorned shredded beef and it really comes to its own in the northern part of Mexico though carne deshebrada is really beloved through the entire country. I'm going to show you how to make a lot of this because I'll tell you when you're going to have a taco party this is something I turn to all the time because it's such a crowd pleaser. Now a lot of people would use they would boil it on the top of the stove and do everything on top of the stove. I think it's way easier to do and especially if you're going to have a party to utilize the slow cooker to do this with. So I'm going to show you how to do that and I'm going to go through the full thing. There are recipes out there that are way simpler than this one but I can tell you they're not going to be as good as this one. It's going to be flavored with beef and we're going to start with a chuck roast. It's going to be beef that is flavored with tomatoes and green chilies and herbs and browned onions so you get the idea. It's a real crowd pleaser. First thing that we're going to do is to roast some poblanos. Now this is not the only chili that you could use for this and I like it to be really full of green chili flavor. So I'm going to take three of these large poblanos here and I'm going to roast them under the broiler. Roasting them on the stove top on the gas flame is totally fine. It just takes a little bit longer in this case. So I'm going to slide them in here and I'm going to keep my eye on them and as they start to blacken and blister I will rotate them and then rotate them and rotate them until they are completely blackened and blistered all over. That will take me 10 or 12 minutes or so to do that and I'll meet you back here when those are all roasted. Okay, we've got those roasted poblanos all ready. Now that's not the only chili that you could use. Some people just like to chop up jalapenos or serranos. You wouldn't roast those and you could just add those with the tomato part of this recipe or one of the things I like to do is use what's called chile guero which is like a hot Hungarian wax or banana pepper, what's called shkatik down in the Yucatan Peninsula. You could roast those and then you could use those in this. I would only use about half as much by weight as what you would use of the poblanos. This was about a pound and a half or about a pound, excuse me, and that would be about a half a pound. Okay, now on to the meat. I am using a two pound chuck roast here because I think that chuck roast gives you the juiciest meat and the best texture. There are a lot of other things you could use for this. You could just buy stew meat in the grocery store, but it oftentimes will come out just a little drier than buying a chuck roast. I'm going to cut this into one inch cubes. Okay, a couple things about the next step. I'm going to brown this meat. You will find lots of recipes where people will just simmer it or just put it right into a slow cooker. I think there's so much more flavor when you brown the meat. So I'm first going to season this meat with salt and then my cooking medium of choice today is going to be bacon fat. It's just fat that I have collected from cooking bacon. You could use oil, you could use rendered pork lard for this, but I'm going to put enough into this base to my slow cooker. Now this is a stovetop safe base to a slow cooker here. If yours is not stovetop safe, you're going to want to do this in a large, a very large skillet. This is just the right size for me to put this amount of meat in there and have it be sort of in a single layer, not too crowded. Too crowded will mean that it won't brown, it'll just kind of start to sweat and boil. I've got a couple pieces there that need to pull apart. Okay, so now you want to hear that good sizzle when you put it in. That means that you've got the temperature right. Because this is stovetop ceramic that I'm working with here, I put it on and let it heat for about six or seven minutes. That's what I'm looking for here. Okay, I'm stopping. I'm not even going to get it all in there. I thought that I would be able to get it all in, but I want to be able to keep it in that single layer so that I can turn it and brown it all. As soon as it's browned, I'm going to put it over here on this rimmed baking sheet. We've got all of the meat browned nicely now. You'll notice that I didn't cut any of the fat out of this chuck roast, and I encourage you to do exactly the same because that will all render, and fat is flavor. When it renders into this whole preparation, it'll just make it taste that much better. You can spoon off the fat at the very end, I'll show you how to do that, but I don't take it off early on in the preparation. Now while that meat was doing its thing in there, I sliced up a couple of big onions, and I'm going to put those into the pan now. Again, if you don't have a stovetop safe insert to your slow cooker, you'll want to do this in that same skillet that you browned the meat in, and we're going to stir this around occasionally until we get these beautifully caramelized. Just look how beautiful those onions are, those will add a lot of sweetness and depth to this. Now we've got our meat to go back in here, make sure you get all of the juices from that. Stir that into an even layer, and then we've got our flavorings to go in here. Of course, those roasted and peeled poblanos are going to be the next layer in all of this. I'll tell you, this is absolutely a glorious smell in the house when you get the meat browned, the onions browned, the roasted chilies, and we're just going to keep that going here. I have a 28-ounce can of fire-roasted tomatoes drained, and I'm going to put those over the top, sort of sprinkling them over the top here, and then we're going to put herbs. You might be using some dried herbs. In Mexico, they sell these little bundles of thyme and marjoram and bay leaves, so I grow those in my garden because I always want to have that around. We've got that going on the top there, then a little bit of Worcestershire. This is my little secret weapon. It will just make it taste that much richer in that umami or beefy kind of flavor, and lastly, we're going to put in here two teaspoons of salt. This is a measured amount, so actually measure it. Don't just sprinkle some in here because that, I know, is what the minimum is that's going to be needed for this, so two teaspoons, and then we're going to go right over now to the slow cooker, so I'll grab this guy, turn it off underneath there, and let's go over here to the slow cooker, slide that right in there. I'm going to turn the guy on here, so I want to go to high, and then I want to put it on six hours, so this is a great thing to do when early in the morning if you're going to have a party in the evening, cover it up, and just let that fill your house with the most glorious aroma ever. Okay, after six hours, this is what it's going to look like. I just pulled this one off of the slow cooker base here, so let's see about what that looks like there. Okay, you can see the thyme branches here and marjoram branches, and then we've got the bay leaves. I'm just going to throw that right over there. I'm going to put this now onto a fairly high fire so that it can come to, it's not wanting to catch there at all, is it? Okay, let's see if we can get there. We got it. Okay, so we're going to let that come to a boil now, but while that's coming to a boil, I'm going to work on potatoes, and I like to add these at the end, not during the whole cooking process, because at the end, they will have their shape. If I put them in at the beginning, they'll all be falling apart. So I'm going to cut this into small cubes. Remember, we are making here a taco filling, so big pieces of potato will not be welcome. I like to square off the potatoes and then cut them into about quarter-inch cubes. Okay, I'm going to blanch these, but I'm going to do it the way that is easiest for me at home, which is not to bring a pot of salted water to a boil, but instead to do it in the microwave. So in a microwave-safe bowl, I will collect all of these potatoes now, and I'm going to put a little bit of water with them, just a little splash. We'll cover that with plastic wrap like that. We don't want that to balloon up too much, so I usually do a couple of pokes with the end of a knife, and we are going to put this in here at four minutes, full power, and we're going to let those par-cook, if you will, in that. Okay, next step is this has come to a boil now. I'm going to turn it way down so that the bubbling kind of goes away, and I'm going to spoon off fat. There's not too much fat in this one here, but you'll want to spoon off a little bit of the fat anyway. You can make a decision on that on your own, but you'll notice that even though we didn't add any liquid to this and we drained the tomatoes, that it's very juicy. So our final step in all of this, I think it looks like it's in pretty good shape now. So our final step here is to shred the meat. You can do it in many different ways, but I'm going to go back to my old-fashioned potato masher because if you work it through here, you will notice that it's just kind of the right piece of equipment. This is also obviously very good for making guacamole. It's where you see me use it the most. I've got one little piece of that thyme that I didn't get earlier, and that's all it takes to break up that meat. You could do it with the back of a large spoon too, it just won't be quite as efficient as that. Okay, I'm going to turn the heat up now underneath this, and I'm just going to let it simmer until it's reduced enough that it's going to kind of hold together. Just think about what you would like to have in your taco. You don't want it to be so juicy that it runs out and runs all over your shirt and all that sort of thing. So we're going to reduce this until most of the juice has gone away. When the potatoes are ready, I'll just mix them right in here so they start to soak up some of the delicious juices that we have here. You've just got to come over here and see this beauty. This to me is the best carne deshebrada because we've concentrated all of those meat juices in this. And you can see how much of the juice now has been evaporated and concentrated into the mixture there. So let's make a taco. I've got some warm tortillas here, put a couple of them on the plate. And it's still juicy, so it's best for me to pick up this plate and just pile that on. Now what I like to do is to put a little queso a\u00f1ejo on it. I know that's sort of gilding the lily, but I love the umami quality, that deliciousness of the a\u00f1ejo-like cheese. You could use a little parmesan or any other kind of like garnishing cheese. Now you could do any kind of salsa with this that you want, or no salsa at all. I happen to like a little bit of the Mexican hot sauce. I'm using tamasula here. Just put a little bit of that and that'll kind of underscore all of those flavors. There you have, I will say, one of the most satisfying, the most crowd-pleasing dishes that you could ever make."}, {"title": "Mushroom Mixiote | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f_nB84Zb76A/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDQij9MbsLHEYXUMLPQUO82zWcGaQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_nB84Zb76A&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=13&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Welcome back to my kitchen, everyone. The next page in our taco manual takes us to a regional specialty called michiotes. Let me explain. So michiotes are found all through the central part of Mexico. The first place I ever encountered them was in the state of Puebla, but you find them all over central Mexico. And they're little packets that you cook food in, but it's that wrapper that's actually called the michiote. And when you see those really large agave plants, you know, the ones that the heart of which is used to make the tequila and mezcal, well, the leaves, the pancas, they call them in Spanish, you can strip a membrane off the outside of them and it looks just like parchment paper. It has an aroma to it, but you can just use that and wrap foods up and then either cook them in a pit in the ground, just like you would barbacoa, or a lot of people will just do it in a steamer. I kind of like to roast them in the oven. And I'm going to take you to a place of making a great taco filling that is made from mushrooms and some potatoes. Little bacon is going to go in there, a bunch of garlic, olive oil. It's just spectacular because as you cook all the food in this sealed pouch, let's call it a pouch like a beggar's purse, all the flavors meld so beautifully that, well, you'll never taste anything quite like it. So to get this thing started, we have to make our pouch exterior. And I'm not going to ask you to go to Mexico and buy michiotes. They're really hard to find and in some states even outlawed because they don't want people going through the agave fields and stripping these membranes off. So a lot of people have moved over to using parchment paper now, which is what we're going to use today for making these. So most of the parchment you find in a grocery store will be in about a 12-inch length roll. And so I want to make a square basically here. If I can get this started. I put my scissors over there because I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do this, but I'm getting pretty good at it here. Okay, so now I've got my square. But we have to actually get these wet so that we can make the into the pouch at the end when we've got all of the ingredients together. So I'm just going to quarter that. I've got three more of them already over here in some water. So I'll just put it down in there and they won't fall apart and they'll just get a little damp and they'll be way more malleable easy to work. So I'll set that aside. Now what I have here is two kinds of mushrooms. You can make this with any kind of mushrooms, but I have a couple of my favorites. One is oyster mushrooms, which I love for their texture and they kind of come together in clumps like that. And then at the bottom of the bowl here, I have a whole bunch of shiitake, which I like for their flavor. It's a really robust flavor. So I'm going to slice these up into about half inch pieces. I've got a couple of boiling potatoes, which I like for their creamy texture. I'm going to cut those into little squares that are a little bigger than a quarter of an inch. I've got eight cloves of garlic. Yes, lots of garlic, which is what is so perfect with the mushrooms. And I'm going to chop that up. I've got a couple of arbol chilies here that I'm just going to cut up. You could use chili flakes for this if you wanted to. And because I love the flavor of mushrooms with bacon, I'm using some bacon. You could leave that out and just increase the oil in this by a little bit. So I'll meet you back here when all that prep is done. Okay, this is what it looks like right here. You can see the pieces of the mushroom, the finely chopped garlic, the potatoes. I've got my little bit of arbol chili there and the pieces of bacon. I'm going to put about a third of a cup, a little over a third of a cup, six tablespoons to be precise, of olive oil in there. You could use regular oil, but I like the flavor of olive oil. And we have to put salt, of course, which I'll do in just a second and an herb. So what I have here is epazote in Mexico. When you're talking mushrooms, you're usually talking about epazote. So it's a jagged leaf herb that you can find in lots and lots of Mexican grocery stores. And it's a kind of strong flavor, best when it is cooked with things. So I'm going to put a couple of big sprigs of that in there, tearing off the leaves. I'm going to chop these guys up. Well, I'm really going to slice them because I like to make those little thin slices like that. So I have the leaves bunched up. I'm just going down, inching my left hand back and cutting all the way down to the end because we took the big, thick stems off of it. OK, about that much of it will be good. This is up to your own taste there. But if you have a chance to use the epazote in here, do it because it's really, really delicious. And then a measured amount of salt for this recipe, which will be a real heaping teaspoon of salt. Mushrooms and potatoes both really need a good amount of salt. So I'm going to sprinkle that over the top of it and then mix everything well together. And then we're ready to make these Michiotes, even though we're not using the true Michiote wrapper for it. But it's the same style of cooking and we'll get a lot of the same results. Now, I said that the true Michiote has a lot of flavor. It's a kind of green flavor and it is distinctive. We of course won't be able to get that in here. But what we're going to produce, I think you're really, really going to like. OK, so our damp pieces of parchment here, I'll take one of them out and show you how we do this. Just unfold it. You don't have to dry it off or anything. We'll put a quarter of this mixture in the middle of it. About like that. And then gather up the four corners. This is the way I do it anyway. Gather up the four corners and then pull the other corners in as well so that you form this little purse like that. And then you'll need string to tie it. What I'm using here is a type of jute that we use for certain things in our restaurant. And it's a pretty color one that you could do with that. You could use baker's, I mean butcher's twine for this. And I'm just going to make a bow here, just like that, so that you've got your purse there. And then I'm going to make three more of these. Okay, we're finished with the making of the packages. I'm going to put them on a rimmed baking sheet. I've got the oven heated to 325 degrees and we're going to bake these for 45 minutes until we can see little bubbles like it's boiling on the inside through the parchment paper. I'll show you what that's like. \u266a\u266a\u266a Okay, it's time to unveil these beauties. I can see that they're really bubbling beautifully, so I know that everything in there is going to be nicely cooked. But let's open one of these packets up here and move it over here. Just pull the string and you can undo that and then open it up. Or if that doesn't come easily, you can always do what I'm prepared to do here, which is just to snip that and open it up. This is the moment that I'm always waiting for because this releases all of that beautiful aroma. So remember what we've got in there is the mushrooms and olive oil and garlic. See the steam come out of there, the little bits of bacon. So once you open this up, and you would have one for each person here, then just stir it nicely. You can see how beautiful that is and how absolutely mouth-watering it looks and smells. I've got warm tortillas here, so I'm going to take a couple of these guys out and lay them over here and spoon on some of this mushroom-mixiote mix here. Yeah, look at that. I like the potato in there. I give you in the recipe also a red chili version of this if you want to go that direction. And if you want to put cactus in it, like goes into a lot of mixiotes, you'll have the recipe for that as well. Next thing to go on here will be just a little bit of roasted tomatillo salsa on each one of them. You can use whatever salsa appeals to you for this. I like to put just a little bit of Mexican queso fresco over the top of it because that adds, I think, a nice dimension of flavor that's really different than the long-cooked mushrooms that are here. Squeeze on just a little bit of lime juice, and right there you have it. Like one of the most amazing flavors, and certainly something you can't get down at your local Taqueria."}, {"title": "Pork Picadillo | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gCX0sI6gIvc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLB1r55dGNNeCwiLOYtr2L0ztyXYxQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCX0sI6gIvc&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=14&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Hello everyone and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to a really classic preparation in the Mexican kitchen called picadillo. It's a ground meat mixture and it's typically made with either ground beef or ground pork. The version that I'm going to make today is made with ground pork and why I'm calling this a regional specialty is because this version of it is not only made with pork but it's made with a local chili to Oaxaca and Oaxacan spices. So it's actually my very very favorite version of picadillo in all of Mexico. Sometimes people will boil beef and shred it and then make their picadillo out of that though that's much less common than using the ground pork that we're working with now. So let's just start this off by talking about that chili that I mentioned that makes this a special flavor. So this is one that is either called chile mije or chile pasilla Oaxacano and it is a long skinny one. All pasillas would be long and skinny like this with a wrinkle skin and when you smell it it has this wonderfully smoky sweet kind of aroma like the best barbecue sauce that you've ever ever tasted. And if you can't find that there's another one that's sort of the closest in flavor and this is the one that you would find in a Mexican grocery store called morita. This one is also a smoked chile and these are really kind of related chilies. So two or three of those in place of one of these. I'm just going to break the top of this off so that I can kind of open it up and get those seeds out of the chilies here and just like let them fall out. I'm not going to be too meticulous with that part. The next step that we have to go to through here is to toast the chili, the dried chili. So I just laid it into a skillet that I've already heated to about medium heat and my I think the best way to toast the chilies so that they get an even toast all through is to press them down with the spatula until either you hear a little crackle or you smell the chili. It just becomes it fills the whole kitchen with its flavor and then press down for a few seconds on the other side. It's a light toast that we're going to give it here and that's really all there is to that part of it here. Okay so I'm going to put it into a small bowl here because we need to rehydrate it. I'm going to do it with some really hot water from the tap here, cover it. Then I'm going to slide this plate. I think I have to put more water in it than that because the plate won't completely cover it but then this will just keep the chili submerged so that it will rehydrate and that'll take about 20 minutes before we start the next steps in our preparations. Okay chili is rehydrated. You can see how much lighter in color it is. That always happens when you rehydrate chilies. We'll set that to the side and start with the pork here. I've got my skillet again heated here this time over about a medium high heat and I'm going to put about a tablespoon and a half of fat in here. You've got your choices. It could be vegetable oil. I'm using a little bit of the bacon fat that I've saved from cooking bacon and once this is pretty much completely melted and it's hot obviously, that's what we want to hear. So I'm going to put this pork into the skillet and then I'm going to use a, I'm breaking it up into pretty big chunks here and I am going to rinse off my hands first here because I've been working with this meat, okay, and then using a wooden spatula I'm going to break this up into smaller pieces and once it's sort of cooked through but not yet browned, we're going to add to it the onions and garlic. So that's our next step here. I'm just going to set this over to the side here and we need about two thirds of this onion here so I'm going to cut that up and I'm going to do it the way that I like to work with onions, which is to cut one direction and then use that structure of the onion and we're cutting this into what I would call about quarter inch pieces, got a little piece of the stem, I mean the root end of it there and we'll need about this much of this one. So I'm going to go ahead and do it that same way that I showed you before and then starting this direction cut through it until I get all the way over to this other side. I can do the same with this last little bit there and we've got our onion ready to go and it's in pretty even pieces, which means even cooking. Now when we're looking at these garlics here, my favorite way to peel the garlic if I am going to be chopping it up, which I am with this one, is just to crush it and that breaks that papery skin off the outside of it. Now there's something else if you're finding that this is a little bit hard to peel, you can go at these things with the root end first and just cut that root end off because that's where it will attach the most and you see how much easier it peels that way. So I'll try that with each one of these guys and then I can just kind of pop it out of the peel that way. There's so many ways to peel garlic but I will say that this is one that is a tried and true method for me and there are some that look like magic that I'm sure you see online and sometimes they really are just like magical things and you don't see what all is going on in the background. Okay once I've got my garlic peeled there, well before we go on to that I should come over here and kind of chop this meat up into smaller pieces now and turn it over so that it can be cooking a little bit on that other side. We're getting it started here, it's starting to render some of its fat. Even I'm seeing a little bit of brown here but it doesn't necessarily need to brown at this stage so that's what it should look like more or less there and let's go back to our garlic here. My way of working with this garlic is to slice it thin so I'm doing all four of the garlic cloves here and once I get those done in slices I'll start the rocking and chopping here which is to hold the blade. I'm right handed so I'm holding the blade with my left hand, of course I'm holding the knife in my right hand but I'm holding down the blade with my left hand and literally walking it across all of these pieces of garlic and you just keep scraping it up and going back and in no time flat you can have very finely chopped garlic. Now there's that word mince that's out there and mince would be extremely finely chopped but I don't even have to go quite to that level of it here. Let's look at our meat again here. This is what I would call finely chopped but not all the way to mince. So I'm just about losing the color now, I'm losing one piece of my meat over there as well so I'm losing the color in the meat and this is the moment at which I am going to put the onions into the skillet. You can see some more rendered fat there beyond the one and a half tablespoons that I started with and we will mix that down in here and we're going to continue to cook this now until we see that the onion has turned translucent and the meat is definitely browning. Browning is what the flavor of this picadillo is all about. Alright we have some nice browning going on down here, completely translucent onions. Now the garlic will go in there. I like to keep one of these little bench scrapers at easy access here so that I can use it to scrape up things like chopped garlic and now we're going to let this cook for a couple of minutes while we make the basic flavorings for this which is going to be tomatoes. I think a can of fire roasted tomatoes is going to be one of the most useful things you can have on your pantry shelf so I'm going to put that into the blender. You could use a food processor here. I'm going to put the chili in there as well. I'll just tear it into some smaller pieces to make sure that it blends evenly with everything and then we will go here into a complete puree. Alright that can go now into the, I can smell the garlic cooking in there. You saw that this has a fair amount of garlic in it which is one of the things that I think makes this such a reliable recipe because it's not just your average ground beef picadillo with very little to set it apart. Now at this point I could have drained off a little bit of the fat that's in this pan if I thought there was an excessive amount but I really don't think there's an excessive amount. This pork was pretty lean so we started, we probably got an extra half tablespoon or maybe a tablespoon of rendered fat out of the pork in addition to the one and a half tablespoons that we started with here. I'm going to turn the temperature down just a touch here and here's what makes this such an exciting recipe. There is a trilogy of flavors you see in a lot of the Oaxacan dishes and that is the cinnamon, black pepper and cloves. So those are things that, at least the cinnamon and cloves, you think of as like baking spices and they add such a sweetness and lightness to this that I just absolutely love. So I'm going to put all of those spices in here and at the same time I'm going to add a tablespoon and a half of vinegar to this and apple cider vinegar is pretty much what you would find. You could use a distilled white here because it's not going to be very much but I will say red wine vinegar or something like that is probably not as welcome here because it has a stronger distinctive flavor. I'm going to stir all of that together here and I've got one more ingredient that I'm going to add before we start this simmer and that's going to take say about 15 or 20 minutes but that is to put some raisins in here. Again the sweetness of the raisins will echo the sweetness or what we associate sweetness with the cinnamon and cloves that are in there. So about a third of a cup of these guys will be the right amount but I have to dig down in here to get some of them to fill out that one third of a cup there and we'll add that in and while this is simmering I'm turning it down even a little bit more so that we have a real simmer not a quick and rapid boil but as this is simmering I'm going to toast a few almonds, the slivered almonds that we'll add to it right at the very end when we season it with salt. It is looking really good here, smelling really good here. When they make the beef version of this and even in some versions of it that are made with pork they'll take the seasonings in a different direction so that they put a little bit black pepper and some cumin and some Mexican oregano. That version I like to chop up olives and add to that can be really delicious but this Oaxacan version of it just leans more into the sweet side of things. I've got my quarter cup here of the slivered almonds that are toasted. We did these in a skillet but you could easily do them in a 325 degree oven. Just keep your eye on them because at around 7 or 8 minutes they'll start to brown and you can burn them really fast. I'll stir that into our mixture then we have to taste and season with salt. I'm always encouraging everybody to taste it unseasoned then add the salt and just take note of the fact that everything is going to come out and come together. I know that this is going to take a couple of teaspoons. Right now the tomato in this is super flat because tomato really does need to have some salt to bring out its flavor. You've had sliced beautiful tomatoes in the summertime and you notice how their flavor just comes alive when you put some salt on them. Same in this particular preparation here. So I'm going to stir in that salt. I measured in about two teaspoons because I know that's what this usually takes and that will be our starting point here. And then I'm going to give it another taste just to see where we are in that. Now the sweetness of the tomato comes forth and marries beautifully with the cinnamon and the cloves and the raisins that I taste in there. And that little bit of sweet, smoky spice that comes from the chili. And now we're ready to turn this into some tacos. This makes a good amount and isn't at all a hard preparation. So it's nice when you're going to have a big group of people over. It really does attract a huge crowd. I will say that everybody loves this preparation here. I'm going to use another kind of spoon here that will be easier for me to maneuver this mixture onto the tortillas that we've warmed up here. So we'll spoon that on there like that. We always figure about a quarter of a cup of filling per tortilla. And you can use that as your standard calculation too. Now this doesn't really need much of a garnish here, but if you want to give it some fresh burst at the end, just have some cilantro around and you can put that on top of it. And what you have here is the Oaxacan version of a classic pork picadillo. One of my absolute favorites and definitely a crowd pleaser."}, {"title": "Ricotta Poblano | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/guzh23C6fqA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDIUnZupIFcXtiSJAB1G2GwNMZqzw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guzh23C6fqA&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=15&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Hi everyone and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is kind of an unusual one but it's a preparation that you will see especially among market vendors all through central and southern Mexico and that is the ricotta taco. Now before you click off just stick with me this is really incredibly delicious and it's something that you can make really quickly. I'm going to roast two poblanos and roast some garlic as the main flavorings for this ricotta taco. So I have the garlic still with a papery husk on and I'm going to throw that into a skillet that's set already over a medium heat. Over high heat here on this one I'm going to lay these poblanos and I'm going to turn them regularly until they blacken and blister all over. We want the garlic to be soft but it'll be a little blotchy black in places that'll take about 15 minutes or so. For those of you that don't have gas flames you can do this as close up underneath a preheated broiler as you can get it and it will take a little bit longer than doing it over the gas flame. But now let's talk ricotta. Most people think about that soupy stuff that you find in most grocery stores. That's very definitely American ricotta but the rest of the world works with something that is much drier than that. Now I'm going to work with store-bought a special kind of store-bought here today but I know a lot of you are really adventurous cooks so at the end of this I'm going to show you how to easily make your own ricotta at home. If you've never tried it it is so fun because you turn out your own cheese really really quickly. Okay so let's look at this. This is old-fashioned it's called old-fashioned ricotta cheese and it is as you can see here quite stiff. It's not real soft and I think that most of the ricotta we see in the grocery stores looks like creamed cottage cheese okay but this is much more like the ricotta that you'll find say in Italy and certainly like the ricotta that you will find in Mexico. So I need about a cup of this stuff here. Now if you only can find the real soupy stuff my suggestion is to scoop out a little bit more than a cup of it and pat it between several layers of paper towels just get all that excess moisture out of it. When all of this here is finished I'm going to use a pair of tongs now to turn this yeah these are looking really nicely blackened that's what I'm looking for there's one spot there that didn't get it so I'm going to hold that over there like that. Let's see what this one looks like same kind of thing it's nicely blackened on that side but I have to even it up by just holding it down over the fire a little bit and when these are finished and the garlic has roasted then I will meet you back here. Now these poblanos have cooled off after roasting them here and you can see that the skins just slip right off of them probably a lot of you have heard that you're supposed to put these into a plastic bag that actually makes them steam and continue cooking so much that I don't like the texture of them I think that's too much you can just let these cool down at room temperature or perhaps throw a kitchen towel over it. Now I have pulled off all most of that blackened skin and then I'm tearing it open like that so that I can get rid of the the seed pod here and then just a very very quick rinse will help me get rid of all the seeds and then on this side I can get rid of the little bits of blackened skin so there's one of them you can see how this just this roasted peel blackened peel and it's a very tough peel is very easy to get off and now that the chili itself is cooked you can just put your finger through it like that and then just peel it open so there you go with the second one I'm going to give it the brief rinse that I did the first like that and then I can just catch all of the seeds and the blackened skin now in the trap of the sink here and easily get rid of that okay now we're ready to talk through that roasted garlic the garlic is completely soft meaning that I can sort of twist it between my fingers and I can feel that it's soft that means it's going to have that wonderfully roasty flavor it's pretty easy to get it to pop right out of the papery skins especially if you do that twist with it because it will separate the garlic clove from the papery skin there or you can use the technique of cutting off that little root end there and it'll peel super fast after that okay I've got just this one last one here to go and then I'm going to do a mince on that and the way that I would do that is exactly the way that I would do it for some raw garlic which means that I'm just going to very thinly slice it now you'll notice how I'm using my knife here that I am not lifting up the end of my knife at all I'm actually using as just a circular motion to slice down through it that way I've got complete control of this knife and I'm not trying to do that kind of motion which never feels very in control to me and then I'll do the rock and chop back and forth here rocking and chopping and walking my knife back and forth to make a very fine mince of this garlic now this may look like a lot of garlic to you but you know that once you cook garlic once you roast garlic or you saute garlic it loses all of that real intense pungency that a lot of people will say they don't like in garlic so one of the things that I just never use raw garlic because of that pungency to it and it's always worth the extra little effort to either do that blanching of garlic that I often do in a microwave where it's covered with water or do the full on dry roasting like they would in Mexico for the garlic itself okay so we've got this very finely chopped now these poblano chiles I'm going to cut them lengthwise in about one quarter inch strips and then gather up those strips and cut them crosswise again about a quarter of an inch so that we have about quarter inch dice here okay our beautiful flavorings are ready now I'll take this dryish ricotta and put it you know in some of the grocery stores here in Chicago they will sell this as hand-dipped ricotta so if that rings a bell for you then it's something that you can look for in your grocery stores now we're going to put all of the roasted garlic in here and then about two-thirds of the roasted poblanos we'll use the rest of it as a little garnish here and then we need to talk about some herbs in this I will say that I'm really into a couple of herbs in this but you can use anything that that suits your fancy or that you have on hand honestly they always have thyme in the Mexican markets so you could use that I'm going to use epazote and some cilantro here and we'll just chop all of that up and let me just show you what this epazote looks like there's a wilted leaf there but for this preparation that wilted leaf will be fine but this is the sawtooth herb that has a real pungent kind of smell but I'll tell you in this preparation it is so good so I'm going to just gather our herbs together like this turn the top down just so that it stays put and then using the knife I'm going to slice very thinly now I've got my left hand bunching the herbs and I'm going to walk my left hand back little by little as I'm making very thin slices of the herbs together here and you'll notice in this situation I'm using the stems and all certainly cilantro stems are very tender and very delicious so then when I run out of everything but just the bottom of the herb branches there I can pick all this stuff up and put that right into the bowl there now we're missing salt and pepper I think ricotta loves pepper so we can start with that and I'm going to put about a half a teaspoon you can suit you can suit your own taste with this but for me a half a teaspoon is a really nice amount because it will actually taste of black pepper it won't just be a hint of black pepper so that should be about the right amount there yeah I got about that and so I put that in there I know we're going to need about a teaspoon of salt so I'm going to start with that before I taste it here because I have made this a bunch and I know that that's going to be it now let's talk about salt and ricotta 99% of the ricotta that you will find will be completely unsalted so when you saw me put a teaspoon of salt in there for just a cup of ricotta you might have thought that that was a lot but ricotta doesn't typically come with any salt if yours does then you're going to want to go much less on that I think we hit all of the flavorings just right in this now this may surprise you to put a cold filling in a taco but all over Mexico there are people that do it all the time and this is absolutely one of my favorite ones now let's talk about the garnishes for this I am going to use a little bit of chopped white onion and so I'm going to cut this up but the next step that I'm going to take with it is to rinse it off you got a little bit of the onion skin on that piece so I'm going to take that off first and I'm going to rinse it with cold water in order to take away that pungency that a lot of people don't like in raw onions you create that when you're chopping it and you break cell walls and you make this sulfurous compound when you do that I think that will probably be enough for me so I'll scoot this over to the side there but I'm going to take it to the sink now and I'm going to rinse it under cold water and it doesn't take very long to do this but it rinses off all that pungency that raw onion pungency and make sure your onions just taste incredibly fresh okay I'm going to put that on this little plate here and then I've got some radish most of you will be buying those round red globes from the grocery store but I thought I would show you a different kind of radish here in Chicago nobody can grow the radishes during the winter but what they do grow in the fall is a type of storage radish and this one I'm going to cut it in half this way so that you can see how beautiful it is so this is called a beauty heart radish and it's just so beautiful but it has it's a storage radish so that we can hold it all winter long but it has a rather tough skin sometimes they call these watermelon radishes for obvious reasons here but so if I cut off that green exterior on this it will be way easier to eat it's a little tough on the exterior certainly don't find that in any of the summertime radishes that we're all so used to here so I'm going to make a a few little radish sticks here and I'm going to do that by slicing first some of this radish just look at how beautiful that is it does definitely resemble a watermelon and then cut little sticks out of that once you get really comfortable with holding a chef's knife in your hand and how to use it for these basic procedures your cooking just goes so much faster and it just I think it's more aesthetically pleasing okay so we've got some of these guys to mix into our fresh raw onion over there that's white onion by the way not yellow onion which is a very different flavor if you haven't ever tasted them side by side I encourage you to do a taste test at some point because it will really surprise you how different their flavors are then really warm steamy hot corn tortillas I'm going to take this one that's down here and leave the top one in place there so we'll line those guys up and on each one of these I'm going to scoop out some of the the ricotta filling here like that and then a second one and then you'll see whether you're using these storage radishes or the regular globe red radishes it's still going to look really beautiful when you sprinkle some of this over the top of it like that see how colorful that makes it and then you get that little bite of the radish in here and then we've got some more of the poblano to go over the top of it and you have an incredibly beautiful and really really satisfying taco a little off the beaten path but one that I think could become a staple in your house now stay tuned for homemade ricotta homemade ricotta it is so easy to do I've got one gallon of milk heating right here now the milk is really important because that's all the flavor here so the better the quality the better the flavor of the milk the better your ricotta is going to be so I always look for one that's grass-fed if I can perhaps organic from a local dairy because I know it's really really fresh and I have slowly heated it in a fairly heavy pot here until it hit about 190 degrees now I've got a yeah I'm just right at 190 degrees right now now if you don't have a thermometer that's okay this milk will if you keep a stir on it so that it doesn't scorch on the bottom of the pan but it will start to steam at about 160 degrees as you're stirring it you'll see the steam start to arise so you want to go a little higher than that I will say the exact temperature on making ricotta is not as critical as some might think so now I hit my 190 I'm going to turn it off now and I'm going to stir in a third of a cup of lime juice so this is not a rennet set cheese like most of the cheeses that you know this is an acid set cheese so this is the whole milk ricotta by the way not the one that is made from whey but we'll talk about whey just in a second so I'm going to just sprinkle this lime juice all over the top of this pot here and then very gently stir it in and the acid is going to coagulate the milk maybe you've had milk in your refrigerator for too long and you tried pouring it out and it was all chunky well that is curdled milk and that's what we're actually going for here we're going to let this steep now for about 10 minutes off the fire and the curds will start to form and they will separate from a sort of clearish liquid that we will call the whey and all we want for our ricotta is just the curds so I'll meet you back here in 10 minutes when this is fully curdled now we're 10 minutes in here it's still steaming so this whole mixture is very hot I'm using one of these sort of skimmers they're oftentimes called a spider in a commercial kitchen and I'm going to go in here very gently and start ladling out you could do this with a little strainer strainer ladling out the curbs curds and I'm putting them into a bigger strainer now that is lined with some cheesecloth now this cheesecloth is has been dampened just to make it easier to work with here so you want to go gently with this part of it but all that it's sort of milky clearish looking liquid the way here you want to get off of this because you want to drain that out now those of you that want to make your own homemade queso fresco you can look on my website and I'll lead you through essentially the same process of making it but for the the ricotta we're going to want it to be lighter in texture than queso fresco so we would just let it hang for longer and press out more of the way but it's a way that if you don't live in an area that has good queso fresco and you want to make something that's got queso fresco in it you can make your own queso fresco in a similar fashion to this much of the the queso fresco in Mexico is set with rennet like most cheeses are but you can make a version of it that is acid set like this so see that you'll get about a pound of ricotta out of a gallon of milk and then you want to just press out a little bit of the way so you can see by just collecting up the four corners of this cheesecloth that you put enough pressure on it to really start draining out a lot of that way at our restaurant we make an acid set queso fresco all the time and we will tie these balls pretty tightly and just let them hang for several hours to get all the way out of them but that's not the exact thing that we're going for here remember that most ricotta is eaten fresh and you may fall in love with this stuff and want it to be on your dessert table all the time the first time i made ricotta i drizzled it with a little bit of honey and i served it with some fresh fruit and i was totally in heaven because this is going to be like the freshest ricotta that you have ever had let this continue to drain now for an hour or two i'm going to open it back up so that you can sort of see in here what we've got you can touch it and feel that it's kind of soft there and it's going to just take a few well i'd say like an hour or so more to drain and then you need to refrigerate it until you're ready to use it but certainly give it an hour or two in the refrigeration and you're going to have amazing fresh homemade ricotta"}, {"title": "Creamy Rajas | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img":

onions. Today, I'm going to show you how to make them. The next page in our taco manual takes us to an iconic preparation of rajas con crema. Now, rajas con crema translates really as strips with cream, but in the Mexican kitchen, when you're talking about strips, it's usually going to be a strip of a roasted poblano chili. So if you could just imagine these flavors, you've got caramelized onions, roasted poblanos, a little garlic. We're going to add a little touch of Mexican oregano to it, and then cream that really thick, beautiful Mexican crema that gets simmered with it until it gets beautifully glazed. An absolutely spectacular thing to just have by itself in a taco. So you can go into many, many taquerias, especially in the central part of Mexico, and they will have rajas con crema on the menu. We're going to add something else to it. We're going to add Mexican greens. Now, when I say Mexican greens, I mean ones that have the kind of flavor of Mexican greens, which are usually the wild lamb's quarters, quelites, or the amaranth greens, the quintoniles. But we're going to be using the black kale, also called lacinado kale, just to give it a little bit more oomph in the preparations. Now, the first thing that we have to do here is to roast the poblano peppers. I'm sure that all of you know what these guys are because they're super widely available in the United States here. I turned the gas burner on high, and I'm just going to lay these over it. I'll bet you some of you have a little wire rack that you put down to roast your peppers. But when you are doing, and this you could do with any green bell peppers or red bell peppers or any of the other kind of big, fleshy peppers, when you lay them on there, you immediately start hearing that little snapping, popping sound because that is the skin blistering. When you roast poblano peppers, you want to blister the skin evenly, blacken it all over because this is a tough skin. And in that process, you're cooking the flesh of the chili, which makes it much more flavorful. So let's just take a look at this, what we've got going so far here. If I turn it over, you can see the blackened skin there. And we just want to keep moving this slightly until we get every part of the skin blackened there. While those are blackening, I'm going to cut up an onion. We're using a white onion here because that's what they use in Mexico. You could use a red onion for this, but it does create a very sweet flavor. Yellow onions are not exactly the right flavor, though if that's all you have, I would go ahead and use it. I'm cutting them a little bit wider than about a quarter of an inch across here. I've got a pan that I've already heated over a medium heat. I'm going to film the bottom of this with oil. I'm using some olive oil. You could use vegetable oil for it. You could even use a little butter here in this preparation. But you'll see the pan is hot so that when I add the onion to it, it's going to start cooking right away. And I want to get these what I'm going to call caramelized, but it's caramelized in a fast way, meaning we're going to get them browned on the outside. They'll start to bring some sweetness from that caramelization, but they'll still have a nice texture in them. Now while that's all working there, let's talk about this kale. If I were in Mexico, I would probably be using the calites de ceniza, the wild lamb's quarters, and they have a flavor very similar to this dark kale, this lacinato kale. But they don't have this central stalk. So when you get your kale, you want to pull out that really tough center stalk there. I've got a couple left here to pull out, but that's a very simple process to do. And then I'm going to cut them crosswise about a half an inch. So just bunch them up like that so that you can go down in at about half inch intervals and cut them all up. This is one of my favorite greens to have in my refrigerator because it lasts for a long time. Now let's pack it into this. This was a half pound bunch to start with. And we'll see that we got about six cups of packed half inch cut leaves there. The chilies have cooled off enough that I can just handle them. The cool thing is that once they do cool off, you'll see that you can slide or rub that charred skin right off of them like that. Now I am doing this over the sink because I like the sink to catch all of the blackened skin. And then my next step is going to be just to break it open like that and tear out that seed pod. And then I'm going to turn the faucet on and use the water to help me get all of these seeds out like that. I find that's just the most efficient way to do it. Flip it over. I'm going to get all of that blackened skin off my hands. And do the same thing on the other side to see if you've got any little stray bits of skin. Next we have to go and slice these into strips. Now these beautiful slices will go in with these caramelized onions, but not until we add a little chopped garlic to the pan. I like the garlic to go in and just be there for about 30-45 seconds until you can smell it. Not until it gets browned. I'm looking for this to be cooked but not browned. I can smell it now. It smells so good. I've got a little bit of Mexican oregano here. Mexican oregano, of course, comes in the holy form if you buy it in a Mexican grocery store. So you need to rub it between your palms to break it up like that. Now the poblano strips will go in here. Once we get that mixed, it's time to add the kale to it. So we'll stir all of that together. The sliced kale will go in. But this is going to take a little bit of time to cook. So I'm going to dribble in here a little bit of water. And because I'm working in a 12-inch skillet and I don't have a top for it, I'm just going to lay a cookie sheet on the top of it. We'll let that cook for about 3 or 4 minutes to soften the kale. We'll uncover it and then we'll add the cream. It's been about 4 minutes or so and you can see that the color of the kale has changed. It's softened up a lot. When I look down here on the bottom, there's none of that moisture left in there. Everything looks like it's coming. And the smell is just so beautiful. That flavor of the roasted poblano is really coming up to greet me, as is the caramelized onions in there. Our last step here is just simply to... Our last step here is simply to scrape in this heavy crema. Now, Mexican crema is not like American sour cream. It's much richer and it's not nearly as sour. Don't try this with sour cream. It'll just curdle in here. If you don't have Mexican crema or the French creme fraiche, which is very similar to the Mexican crema, then I would suggest just using heavy cream. Stirring this around long enough for it to reduce a little bit and coat the ingredients is all we lack. It's almost reduced enough, that cream, to coat everything beautifully. It needs to be salted. Now, this will take a little bit more salt than what you expect because those greens just love salt. So I sprinkled all of that over, mixed that nicely, and we are ready to make tacos. I'm going to set that there. And I've got warm tortillas here in our traditional Mexican style. Lay a couple of them here on a plate, steaming hot. And then take some of the creamy roasted poblanos, caramelized onions, and kale. Now, I like to put cheese on top of this, but Mexican style cheese, either the queso fresco, the fresh cheese, or this is like the a\u00f1ejo cheese, the kind that you might hear called cotija cheese. It's a little punchier, and I think that makes a really delicious, delicious top to this. And here we are with one of our iconic flavors, the creamy roasted poblano rajas, oh, with so many other good things. \u266a\u266a\u266a"}, {"title": "Fresh Cheese in Tomatillo Salsa | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gc52Di2-6jE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAeFysNBizj6YAyAuesMgBAc4y2rg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc52Di2-6jE&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=17&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Hi everybody and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual brings us to a regional specialty that's all about fresh cheese in roasted tomatillo salsa, green salsa. Now I've got a lot to say about the fresh cheese to make it absolutely easy and doable for you. But the first thing I want to do is get started to make the roasted tomatillo salsa. I've got four tomatillos here, big tomatillos. You first of course have to take that papery husk off. You could rinse off the little stickiness that's on the outside. I've got three cloves of garlic but they're still in their papery skins. Some serrano chili here or a small jalapeno would work with the stem off of it. And alongside that I'm going to roast some red onion. I want to do that in pretty thick slices here. So I'm going to cut this basically into four rounds. Keeping it in rounds like this will definitely help with the moving around and turning over and stuff like that rather than doing it in half moons where they would kind of fall apart. And in typical Mexican style we're going to dry roast all of this rather than put some oil on it before we roast it. So I've got my broiler here heated and I've got the shelf at the highest level about four inches away from the heating element. And I'm going to just slide this in. That's going to take about six minutes per side. So we'll look at it and look and see how much blotchy black there is on stuff because we want a good amount of that but we also want to cook everything all the way through. But getting that little bit of char on that really really gives you a lot more flavor. Now let's talk fresh cheese. So in Mexico there's two kinds of fresh cheese that people talk about all the time. The most common one is queso fresco or fresh cheese and I've got this one here. This comes from a local V&V Supremo cheese company here in Chicago and I think is a really really good quality queso fresco. But there are many many different ones out there and to tell you the truth they all sort of taste the same. Now over here is one that's less common but you can certainly find it here in the United States. This is a panela cheese and it's got a very different texture. Now the fresco cheese when you cut a little piece of that off you'll notice that it's curdy and it's easy to to crumble between your fingers like that. So this is a garnishing cheese it's kind of salty and when you taste it the the flavor of it is like capturing fresh milk. That's what you want. There's a little bit of acidity there there's a nice amount of salt but it's used to give a freshness to a finished dish. Very common in the Mexican types of antojitos the things that are like the the fried rolled fried tacos any kind of a sope on tacos all kinds of things like that. Now the panela cheese is made in a similar fashion to the queso fresco but instead of crumbling up the curd so that before it's packed like this so that it will easily crumble when you run it between your fingers the curd in this one is put into a basket you can even see the the little indentations of the basket here and you can't really crumble this one at all. You want to crumble in that same way and again when you taste it it's going to have a light milky kind of flavor but a little bit more of a spongy texture where this is quite dense. Now you can you can fry either one of these and that's what we're going to do here. You can fry either one because they do not melt. These fresh cheeses do not melt because of the way that they're they're made. So what I'm going to use here I've cut about half inch squares half the panela cheese which will give us a little bit lighter texture and half of the queso fresco which will give us a little bit denser but at the same time sort of softening texture. It's absolutely delicious so you've got to try this because you've got to get that texture and enveloping all of that in salsa verde is really beautiful because fresh milky cheese and the tanginess of salsa verde is just like a match made in heaven. Okay so I'm going to meet you back here once the ingredients for the salsa verde and the onions have been fully roasted. Okay I want to show you this what we what we've got here. So these tomatillos are looking really good now because they've got some splotchy dark spots on them. I wouldn't mind them being a little bit darker than that because it adds more flavor that darkness adds flavor. But we're doing okay here you can see that the little serrano chili is blistered and blackened on one side. The same thing goes for these little garlic cloves here. Our onions not doing as well as what I was hoping it would do for this. So we're going to just leave it on that side for another few minutes. In about three or four minutes I will look back in here because my guess is that that serrano chili is going to be ready and perhaps those garlic cloves will be ready as well. Everything for the salsa is ready I let it cool down just a little bit to tell you the truth. I did put the onions back in a little bit longer than everything else on this tray because they just needed a little bit more time. I'm going to separate them out here because I'm going to chop those to add separately. I'm using red onion here you could use white onion if you want to. But we do have to peel the garlic that papery skin off of it. I like to leave it on when I'm roasting under a broiler like this just simply because it protects the garlic from getting too dark. But then you can just put that right directly into the blender jar where we're going to collect everything else. Now if the tomatillos have given off a fair amount of juice which probably will happen you don't want to leave that on the tray because the juice is like one of the most delicious parts of all of this. And if you have forgotten to take the stem off of your little green chili you'll want to take it off now because you don't want to put that in there as well. I did mine earlier. And then we've got these tomatillos that are going to go in here. And I put the foil on here because it does make for an easier clean up here. You don't burn a lot of stuff onto your to your bake. Oops, I just lost all of my stuff from the garlic there. So we'll get all of that stuff back together here. And then we're going to blend this but I'm going to add about a half a teaspoon of salt just to get it mixed in there very nicely. And I'm going to add a half a cup of water to it because we're going to need more liquid there than what we would get out of those roasted tomatillos. So I'm going to go in with my, I just grabbed the quarter there, but the half a teaspoon of salt. It's going to need a generous half teaspoon of salt. So we'll put that in there. And then we're going to blend it to what I call a coarse puree, which just simply means that there'll be a little texture left. It's not going to be completely smooth. Looks good to me. You can still see some pieces of tomatillo in there. That's exactly what I'm looking for. And now this part of it, I want to cut up into small pieces. You want them to be a little bit smaller than those pieces of the the cheese are because the cheese will lose a little bit of its size as we're working here. And this will add not only that depth of flavor that you get from the roasting of the onion, but it'll also add a nice little, I won't call it a crunch, but it'll add some nice texture to it. We're going to leave all of that there. Now our next thing to do here is to heat this pan and I'm going to do it over about what I would call a medium high heat. And I'm going to film it with olive oil. This will take a couple of tablespoons of olive oil because you really want to sear this cheese. And I'm going to dry off surface moisture from the cheese here because these are fresh cheeses and they will have a fair amount of surface moisture on them. You'll notice that they will brown slightly differently. The queso fresco versus the panela cheese. So we'll just fold the edges in so that we can pat off that surface moisture. That'll help it to brown nicely. So we've got that right. I think that this needs just a minute more. It doesn't feel quite hot enough here. Now I have a confession to make. I have taken two recipes and kind of put them together. In Oaxaca, they sear the cheese, usually queso fresco, and then put a tomato sauce that is seasoned with the chile pasilla Oaxacano, the smoky Oaxacano chili. And I love that. And it's a typical what they would call almuerzo, late morning breakfast kind of dish. And in the central part of Mexico, around Guadalajara, where the panela cheese is very popular, they will just warm up the salsa verde and throw unseared cheese into that and serve it as a kind of appetizer. Everybody takes it out. I'm going to show you a really cool thing that you could do with that. But I have taken the seared cheese from Oaxaca and blended it with the salsa verde from the west central section of Mexico and made this thing because I like those things coming together. The tanginess of salsa verde and the browned quality that you get out of putting the cheese, like I'm going to do right now, into the hot oil and browning it. So we'll lay that in there. We want a pretty flat layer here. I'm doing it in a nonstick skillet. That would be what I would recommend to you. Shake it a little bit so that you get it all, everything in one layer there. And then we're going to let it brown kind of undisturbed for a couple of minutes. And then we'll come in with a spatula. I have a nonstick spatula here that I'm going to go in. But if it doesn't work very well, like if it's sort of sticky a little bit, I'm going to use this one. But I'm going to use it very carefully so as not to hurt the surface of the pan. OK, everything really came free easily. So I'm using the nonstick spatula here. You can look at that beautiful color that is on there. And the smell, of course, is that beautiful cheese smell. OK, so now is the time that we're going to put the salsa verde in on top of this. And then we're going to also, at the same time, put those roasted red onions on there. So there's our roasted tomatillo salsa. Now our onions go over that. All we have to do is to bring that to a simmer. And then we will check for seasoning. So I kind of go in here gently because I don't want to, you'll notice that these pieces of cheese have softened, but they don't really melt. They just soften a little bit. Look at that, though. Doesn't that look just utterly delicious? Now give it a taste at this point. You've got everything all mixed together here. And I will see if I need to add just a pinch of salt or a little bit of sugar to balance the natural acidity that you get from the tomatillos. Yeah, so I'm going to put just a little bit of salt on there. The tomatillos have a fair amount of acidity, so now I'm going to put that. Just a sprinkling of sugar. And the last thing is that is just seasoning together and coming to a full boil is to put a nice handful of cilantro in there. So we'll get this out there so that we can do that folding under of the top part of the cilantro. And then making that chiffonade, that very thin slice as we move down the stems, but just keeping everything kind of bunched up here. And this freshness is very much welcome in this dish, which has a fair amount of richness from the cheese. Okay, got a nice amount there. Get rid of the stems there. Sprinkle that over the top of it. I'm going to use the spatula again to give it one last stir. But when I do this dish, I always like to just set this skillet right in the middle of the table. Put some warm tortillas out, which I have here, and let everybody help themselves. But if you're in the West Central part of Mexico, then you will see it served this way an awful lot. So I have a molcajete that I have heated up here over a fire for a little bed. It's sort of a medium low heat. So I put it over there so it would heat up. And this can be a vessel that you use to keep this all warm, whereas it would continue to cool off in the skillet. But you would just scoop it into that skillet. I'll grab a big spoon here and show you what I mean about that. And it'll sizzle some when it goes in there. And then you just scoop it all in. And you have your fresh cheese, queso fresco or panela cheese, simmering away in that molcajete. Scoot out some warm corn tortillas and make a beautiful taco. And I'll tell you, it's delicious."}, {"title": "Chicken Tinga Tacos | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cz9aEY5EkKI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCB4BXARvkkZcbjbttiPJp7GkFVrQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz9aEY5EkKI&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=18&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Chicken Tinga Tacos with Caramelized Onions and Smoky Chipotle. Hello and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is one of my favorite recipes of all time. And I think it will become one of yours. It is Tacos of Chicken Tinga. Now, why is Chicken Tinga so popular? Well, just think about it. It's chicken with tomato and a smoky chipotle chili, some caramelized onions. I mean, it's just absolutely spectacularly delicious. And pretty much everybody finds it that way. The original is made with pork, but that's served more as an entree. But throughout central Mexico, you can find lots of the taco stalls having Chicken Tinga to offer. Now, there's one thing that I want to show you with this. Because to me, it's sort of important. And it really may enhance your enjoyment of this dish too. First of all, we all think about chipotle chilies as what comes in the can. It's a dehydrated chili that's been reconstituted in a vinegary tomato sauce in the can. Super easy to work with and we all love it. You can use that too. But what I'm going to show you is what they do in the city of Puebla when they're making this dish all the time. And that is to put a sweet and sour pickled chipotle in there. And this is the chili that we're going to be using. It's the same thing that's in the can. But when you go into your Mexican grocery store to look for it or buy it online, it will likely be called a chili morita. M-O-R-I-T-A. Morita. Nomenclature with chilies is just crazy. Just take my word for it. You'll buy dehydrated morita chilies. So we're going to make this sweet and sour brine for it. I'm starting off here with apple cider vinegar. And I'm going to dilute it by half with water. So I've got a half a cup of vinegar, half a cup of water. I've already got my pan on here heating just to make this whole thing go faster. And so I'm going to put it over kind of a medium heat now and bring that to a boil. And we're going to sweeten it with piloncillo. You can use regular sugar if you want or dark brown sugar. This unrefined sugar that comes in hard cones in Mexico is the classic thing. This has more of a molasses-like flavor even than the brown sugar will be. You can see how incredibly hard it is. You can cut it up or not, depending on what size knife you have and how much energy you have. It will just dissolve a little bit faster if you just chop it roughly here. Some people like to actually put it in a microwave oven. That will make it kind of unstable and it will crumble basically. But it will be kind of hot, so you have to watch that. Okay, so we've got that in there. I'm going to stir this for a few minutes until all of that piloncillo has completely dissolved. That piloncillo is finished now dissolving in the vinegar and water. I've got three cloves of garlic and I'm going to put those in there. I'm going to measure the dried chilies. For this amount, it's about 20 pieces, about 2 ounces of those little chilies there. I'm going to measure in now half a teaspoon of salt. We're going to let this simmer for a couple of minutes. I'm going to pour these into a bowl here. I like to weight them with a plate to keep them submerged so that they rehydrate evenly. A couple of hours and we'll be ready to use these guys. Now on to the tinga. I said that it has caramelized onions in it and it's a fair amount of onion. We're talking a different kind of caramelized onions than the kind that you would use for a French onion soup where they're fall apart tender. Typically in the Mexican kitchen, when you're caramelizing onions, you're doing it over a fairly high fire. I've got my skillet already on a medium-high heat here, preheating so that I can start this. We can start to get some beautiful color on these onions before they get too soft. I've even had an all-vegetable tinga in the city of Puebla that was mostly just caramelized onions with some tomato and those pickled chipotles. We need some fat to do this. I'm going to use olive oil. You could use any kind of fat that you want. A lot of times people in Mexico would use fresh rendered pork fat for this one. I'm going to nicely coat the bottom of a very large skillet with some olive oil. Then I'm going to put in the onions. Now, while those are starting to brown, I'm going to deal with the chicken here. This is boneless, skinless chicken thighs. You could make it with chicken breast if you want, but it'll always come out drier. I'm going to cut these boneless, skinless chicken thighs into pieces that are a little bit smaller than a half an inch. Alright, the chicken is going to go in. The onions are browned. At this point, I really want to spread out the chicken so that it touches the bottom of the pan. I'm going to let that cook for about four or five minutes until it starts to get really browned underneath. Then I'll start mixing everything. Browned is where all the flavor is, so that's a very important step. I'm going to scrape all this beautifully browned chicken up. I'm going to add chopped garlic. I've already chopped up those three cloves that I had over there. Now, this just smells so good. First of all, just browning onions always smells good, but then you add this chicken thigh in there. That looks so pretty. Scrape up my garlic and put that in there. This will only take about a minute or so. What I'm going to look for here, well, it's not even look for. What I'm going to smell for here is just the smell of garlic. Once it has released its aroma, then you know it's cooked enough for it to be less harsh than if it was raw garlic going in here. While that is finishing there, I'm going to blend up a can of tomatoes. If you really want to have that great flavor, then I would suggest that you choose the ones that are fire roasted. I don't want to blend these too much, just a very, very coarse puree. I think that'll be about right for this. Very little pureeing, but it is pureed, but it's got a lot of texture to it. That'll go into the skillet here. Then I'm going to stir that around just to mix it, and we will add the other two seasonings. One of which, of course, is going to be the chipotles. If you're working with the canned chipotles for this dish, then you will just open the can and chop up three or four of them. Since I'm working with the sweet and sour pickle chipotles here, I'm going to pull out three of these. I'm going to put four of them in there because their flavor is so dynamic, sort of smoky, sweet, and spicy. When you're working with small chilies in Mexico, it's very typical to leave the seeds in them in the salsa or sauce. Not so much for the dried chilies that are large like ancho or guajillo. I'll chop those. Well, I'm really just slicing them thinly here. We'll sprinkle that over the pan. Then I'm going to add a little bit of Mexican oregano, a very, very classic flavor to go into the tinga. I'm going to put about a teaspoon or so of it. When you buy this in the Mexican grocery store, it will come in the whole leaf form. You put it in the palm of your hand and then rub both palms together like this and over the pan. That crushes everything. If there are any stems in there, it will break the stems up. We're going to let this simmer for a few minutes until it all comes together and it's like a really lovely taco-filling consistency. Not too runny, but not too over-reduced and stiff. This is looking and smelling really, really great. I'm going to add a teaspoon of salt to it, which is usually what this takes. But then, of course, we'll have to taste it as well and see where it is and adjust seasonings. One of the ways that you might adjust the seasonings with this also is with a little bit more vinegar or more of the juice from those chilies that we pickled here. I'm going to give this a little taste. It needs two things. It needs a bit more salt and it needs some of the acid from the chilies. I'll just pour a little bit of that in there. It's really nicely spicy. Those chilies are not the spiciest things in the world, but we put quite a few of them in here. As a taco-filling, I think it's really delicious. If you're looking for something on the milder side, then put less than what I said for you there. Let's see what we get here. While this is finishing simmering, we've got some really classic garnishes. Of course, we've got our hot corn tortillas for this. Then I've got avocado and fresh cheese, two things that are absolutely delicious with this. I'll show you one of the ways that I like to\u2014it's a kind of street vendor way of dealing with avocado. That is to cut through the avocado skin so that you have these beautiful slices here. You can just peel off the outside of it and then cut up like that. It makes it just really easy. Then as you're making tacos, you just peel each slice and they stay in really great shape that way. We've got the fresh cheese that's already crumbled there. We've got a little bit of cilantro here because I just like the way that it looks. Let's build tacos now. I've got corn tortillas. I'll grab a couple of them and put them on a plate here like that. We've got our finished chicken tinga. I'm going to use a spoon to just grab some to layer down in the middle here of the tortillas. That looks good and it certainly smells absolutely beautiful. A little bit of avocado over the top there like that. Our sprinkling of the fresh cheese over it. I'm just going to lay on a couple of wedges of lime because, of course, you need that always to squeeze on top. Then some cilantro leaves. I'll tell you, you've got a beautiful, beautiful taco there. You're going to want to make these."}, {"title": "Easy Tomatillo Arbol Chile Salsa | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjiQZFxjH1k/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBojsI_s5Lplg5uia0yevCoIH8UzA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjiQZFxjH1k&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=19&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Arbol tomatillo salsa to invigorate any taco.

Welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is Chilorio. Maybe something you haven't heard of before, but it is very common. And it is a very common dish in the northern part of Mexico, especially in the state of Sinaloa. And when I have had it there, I've found it in the markets as a sort of preserved pork dish. So just imagine this. It's like a pulled pork kind of thing that is cooked with chilies and some acid, salt, and a fair amount of fat. And then when all of that gets cooked together, it forms this sort of shredded mixture that can actually be preserved at room temperature for quite some time. Now that's not the way that people do it so much these days because people just love the flavor of this red chili pulled pork and they make it to serve right away. That's the version that I'm going to show you how to work with today. So let's talk about the pork first. When you're making a small amount of this, it can be a whole hog kind of thing, but we're going to start with the pork shoulder roast, the boneless pork shoulder roast. And I have a pound and a half of it here and I'm going to cut it into one inch pieces. Now I'm going to tell you that this size matters when it comes to the size of these pieces here because of the fact that it will change the cooking time if you're working with large pieces. I'm going to cut this into the one inch pieces and then we're going to put them all into a pan to cook. Now there's several different ways to cook the pork here and it is important that you know that you have alternatives. I'm going to show you the version that goes on the stovetop. Easiest by far. You put some liquid in the seasonings in with the pork and then you let it cook at a gentle simmer for about an hour and a half. That's the version I'm going to show you, but it's not the only version you can do. If you have an electric pressure cooker like an instant pot, you can do it in there in 40 minutes instead of an hour and a half on the stovetop. Or if you like the low and slow, you can do this in your slow cooker in the recipe that I'm going to give you all the directions are there. Okay, so I've got this now cut up into the one inch pieces and I'm going to put those guys into this large pot over here. You want a fairly good size pot so that when it is simmering, it's all simmering very evenly. That's enough to cover about a one inch layer on the bottom of this. I'm going to take a break for a second and go wash my hands. Now onto the seasonings. This is a red chili braise. And the nice thing is that this long, slow cooking time, whether you're on the stovetop or slow cooker or pressure cooker is long enough that you don't have to jump through all the hoops that you do when making a red chili sauce, like toasting and soaking the chili. So this one is going to be seasoned with ancho chiles. Of course you have to open them up like that. Don't let the seeds fall out. You're going to pull off the stem end of it like that. And then I just tear these chilies into large pieces and I'm going to put them straight into a blender jar. Obviously not something you see me do very often because I'm oftentimes making moles or red chili sauces that require me to toast and soak the chilies here. So in those guys go, usually you'll see me doing a toasting of garlic to take away its pungency. But again, this long slow cooking is going to really tame that raw garlic flavor. So I'm going to put four cloves of garlic directly in here. We have now, um, a cup of orange juice. You don't see this in too many recipes for chilorio, but I collected a cookbook when I was up in Sinaloa, I'm going to say like 30 or 40 years ago and it had a special chilorio recipe that called for orange juice. I tried it and loved it. So it has been part of my repertoire for a long time now. So that will go in here a couple of tablespoons of vinegar. I think an apple cider vinegar works really good here because it's got a real pungency to it. And then I've got spices that are going to go typical Northern spices, a little bit of cumin and a little bit of black pepper here. Actually quite a bit of black pepper there. And I'm going to put them into the molcajete and crush them. You may be working with already ground spices, so you'll just measure those guys out. But I just love the aroma of fresh ground spices. So I will always do that grinding right before using. Just take a second to smell this. Smells so, so good. Fresh ground cumin is nothing like pre-ground cumin, which has a much, I'm going to say funkier kind of aroma to it. Our last spice or herb in this case that's going to go in here is Mexican oregano. I'm going to put about a teaspoon in there because you can see here that it has the whole flower buds and it's got a little of the sticks that was from the collection of it in there. And that's the way it's sold in the Mexican market. You have to pulverize it, but it's usually very simple process of just letting it fall from your palms as you rub your palms together like that. So we got all of that in there now. And I'm going to put in some salt. This is a measured amount of salt just simply because we are working with a braise thing going on in here. And I'm going to start with my tablespoon, excuse me, my teaspoon and a half of salt and we can come back and season this later on to get the final seasonings just right. Top goes on and we're going to make an absolutely smooth puree out of these seasonings. Now because I'm using a high speed blender for this, I don't really have to strain this, but if you're using a regular blender, then you're going to need to press it through a medium mesh sieve to get out any stray seeds or little bits of skin that didn't get completely pulverized in this blending process. So we're going to put all of this now over the meat and because this is going to be a stove top braise, I'm going to add a little bit of water to it because it will be more evaporation. If you're doing it in a slow cooker or if you're doing it in a electric pressure cooker, then you don't add the water to it. That's the really the only difference in this. Okay, so mix all of that up, dilute it with a half cup of water, turn on the fire here and adjust it to a kind of medium low. You want a very small amount of movement and we're going to let this braise for about an hour and a half until that meat is fall apart tender. This stuff is simmering away. I already checked the meat to make sure that it was completely tender. I'm going to take the meat out of here, leaving behind the juice. Now during stove top simmering like this, really you have to keep an eye on it because if it starts to dry out and there's not much braising liquid there or simmering liquid, you have to add a little bit more water. So you'll need to keep an eye on it. It's only an hour and a half. If you're making other things in the kitchen, perhaps you could do that. You want about a half a cup of sort of that thickish braising liquid left in the pan. I'm going to let this cool for just a minute and then come back to it and shred it. And that'll give me a chance to also measure how much of this liquid I have here. Okay. I am using the technique for shredding this pork of a gloved hand because that's the easiest and fastest way to do it. You might like to take a couple of forks held back to back and pull the meat apart. It just takes me a lot longer to do it that way. Now our next step here with this meat is to brown it. To brown it. And this is such an important part. When I'm in Mexico city in the grocery store that is near my apartment, they have all this Chilorio in little bags or, um, pouches, cans. I've tried them all and they're what they're missing is balanced flavor and this browning step, which to me is everything. You can do the step in oil or you can do the step in fresh rendered pork lard, which is what I'm going to do, which gives it absolutely the best flavor that you can even imagine. But you're going to want to use good lard if you're going to do this, not the stuff that is like in those bricks in the grocery store, something from a butcher shop. I've got this over about a medium high heat and I'm going to put all of our shredded. This is just coarsely shredded, not finely shredded, but all the pork is coarsely shredded in here. And I'm just going to let that sit for a minute. So it starts to Brown underneath and then I'll start to stir it. This won't take more than about two and a half, three minutes or so for this to Brown nicely. But again, that Browning is where you're going to get so much flavor. Okay. In goes the braising liquid, which is almost a sauce like consistency here, but man, it's packed with flavor as well. All we want to do is let this reduce for a short period of time for everything to come together because it's already completely cooked, but we don't want this to be runny in any way, but it shouldn't take very long at all. I'm going to turn the fire off now because you can see how beautiful this is and how it's come together. There's so much flavor in this particular product that I will say it needs very little for when you're going to serve it. Maybe some salsa, some onions and cilantro in a very classic Mexican taqueria way. So on each one of these tortillas, I'm going to put a nice spoonful of the Chilorio. I'm doing this in Mexican style. These are not going to be over full because there's so much flavor here. So you don't want to do too much on that. And then for some heat, this Arbol Roasted Tomatillo Salsa I think is just perfect in here, but it's really just going to add that bright, acidic, wonderful contrast. A little bit of onions and cilantro over the top of it. And there you've got a regional classic. This is Chilorio from the state of Sinaloa."}, {"title": "Onions & Cilantro, Explained | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gOy-4vHKI54/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBrBqel20q9Becd_IPjUi9IEiSDzQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOy-4vHKI54&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=21&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "The most common garnish on any taco in Mexico is onions and cilantro. I mean, you go to any street vendor, they'll always ask you, do you want onions and cilantro? Let me show you how to make them. We got to start with the onion part of it because it's really critical. It's not a yellow onion, even though that's probably what you have in your kitchen right now. You have to have a white onion. Why? Because the flavor is very different. Yellow onions are sweet and complex. These are crisp and bright and perfect as a garnish for a taco. So I'm going to cut off a piece of this white onion here, and then I'm going to cut it into small cubes. We would say dice here. And then I'm going to show you the most important aspect of this. I'm going to do what they call in Mexico, deslimando la cebolla. I'm going to deflame the onion. Now, anytime we work with onions, people are always like, oh, I hate working with raw onions because they make my eyes water, or they give me onion breath, or they're hard to digest. Well, when you cut through an onion, you bring two elements together that creates a sulfurous compound. You created it, you can get rid of it. All you need to do is to scrape all of your onion into a strainer, and then you're going to rinse it under cold water. I'm going to rinse it really well. Nothing, no tricks here at all. Just rinse it really well, and then shake off the excess water into a bowl here, and now on to the cilantro. Don't waste your time picking the leaves off of the cilantro. The stems are super tender, and they're very, very flavorful. So do what those street vendors do. Take the bunch of cilantro, a handful of it, and then turn the top underneath so that you can hold it in place like that, and then make very, very thin slices here. Now, I'm working with the blade of the knife right up against my knuckle, so I know exactly where it is at all times here, and I'm just barely inching back my hand so that once I get to the place where all I can feel is stems, then I'm done. What I have here is very, very finely chopped cilantro. If you want to go through this extra step, you can, which is to toss the very thinly sliced cilantro like this, and then pick the top part of it off, and you'll see a lot of stems on the bottom. I don't even go through that step because this is so tender and delicious, those stems are, that just mixing everything together like that gives you the classic Mexican street vendor onions and cilantro for your tacos."}, {"title": "Raw Tomatillo Salsa | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R4RgAmYrE-U/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCYUcnSMm2bwKkXR20KgIGT2sl3Ag", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4RgAmYrE-U&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=22&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Hi and welcome back to my kitchen! The next page in our taco manual takes us to one of my favorite salsas. I think I say that about every single one of these salsas, but this is kind of what they would call a guacamole in most of the taquerias in Mexico City anyway, and sometimes we call it avocado tomatillo salsa, but it's made with all raw ingredients. So I have tomatillos here, I have green chilies here, I've got some cilantro. That forms the base of it, but it's all thickened with a good ripe avocado. So the first thing that we have to do here is to cut up the tomatillos. Of course I took them out of their little papery husk already, rinsed them off, and now I'm quartering them. It's a rough cut, it's nothing particularly special here, and I'm going to put all of those into a blender jar. And then let's talk about the green chilies. You could use any kind of green chili, hot green chili, for this. I'm using serranos here. In most of the taquerias in Mexico City they make this stuff really spicy, so you won't use too much of it because we all know avocados are very expensive. So I've got a couple of them here. If you don't like really hot food, you're going to want to start with one serrano or maybe even a small jalapeno or half of a larger one. I'm going to throw those in there. Those are going to be spicy. I can actually feel the spice in the back of my throat. I just tear off some of this cilantro, give it a second tear, and throw that in the top of it. And I'm going to make a kind of slushy mixture here, putting about a third of a cup or so of water in. And then I'm going to turn this thing on, starting slow and waiting till most stuff gets caught before I start to go up in the speed here. And that's kind of what I'm looking for. I don't want it to be too smooth. I mean you could make this into a very smooth salsa, but I don't need to do that. I want to see little pieces because I like the texture of the not completely smooth tomatillos there. So we've got a ripe avocado here. Go around the pit, scoop the two sides apart, get rid of the avocado's pit, and then scrape the the flesh here from the skin. And if it's a really ripe one, that will come very easily. Second half goes in here. This has got a, usually these Hass avocado skins are very tough, but this particular one feels a little bit softer than what I'm used to. And then we're going to run this machine again so that we can thicken that sort of puree of tomatillo and the other flavorings. And you'll notice that it just becomes beautifully homogenous. This is so perfect to have with tacos because it's not like big spoonfuls of guacamole. It's like a salsa, like a Mexican salsa that you can put on top, drizzle over say carne asada that you have chopped up. Okay, so now I have to do a couple of things here. One is I have to season this guy and I'm going to put some salt in it and then taste it and see if I have the right flavor here with that much. But look at the texture of this stuff. It's just so good. And you, all of the proportions are up to you. If you like it spicier, if you like more cilantro, you can add more of those things. Yeah, it's so good. It's so fresh because the freshness of the tomatillos and the freshness of the cilantro are just perfect. Now you may do this or you may not. I like to take a little bit of white onion, chop it fine, and then rinse it off. That takes away all of the strong stuff that most people don't like about raw onion. And put that, many of you have seen me rinse onions many times, but this will give it a nice consistency, a little crunch in there, a texture that I really, really like. Okay, one more taste just because I think it's so good. You got to have this when you have tacos."}, {"title": "Tacos de Suadero | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAY6GyHQPMc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBlX9F7Q3scLWucip5oGMdA6VFFuA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAY6GyHQPMc&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=23&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Have you ever heard of tacos de suadero? My God, they're like the beefiest, most delicious tacos in the entire world. And I'm going to teach you how to make them. Welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to suadero. Now don't just click off if you don't know what suadero is because you're going to want to know what suadero is. It's one of the most delicious tacos that's made anywhere in Mexico and it's a beef taco. Now you know what carnitas are, right? I mean it's pork that's cooked in its own fat and you know how delicious that is. Well think of suadero as the beef version of that. Now in the old days, the butchers were trying to figure out things that they could do that would add value to some of the cuts that they just ground into hamburger meat. And so some of these cuts were very delicious but they were also very tough. So they figured out that some of these muscles that you find sort of in this section of a cow, stuff that always just got ground, could be cooked slowly. Well think about brisket and how long you have to cook brisket to get it tender. But there's a lot of other cuts. So this one, this huge thing here, is what they came up with. This is a cut that's called navel. You've probably never heard of it because I had it until I started doing all the suadero research. But this is the cut that most people point to as the original suadero cut. You won't find it in your grocery store. So what will you find? Well let's go to brisket. So I have brisket here. This is brisket from the part that they call the flat part of it. It's the thick part of the brisket. I always choose that if I'm not going to do a whole brisket because it's fattier and a beefier flavor. So that's what I've chosen. I've got a couple pounds of that. And I've got some chorizo that I'm going to talk about here in a minute. So how is it cooked? Let me show you the traditional way. This contraption is called a choricera. And the people that work with it are usually making what everybody in Mexico City that I know calls tacos de fritangas or stuff that's all fried. Now this is a home size version of it because in Mexico City they're huge like this. But I wanted to show you what this is so that you could get an idea for how it's used. So what I have around the outside here is melted pork lard. This is fresh rendered pork lard. And that's our primary cooking medium. The heat is right under this domed part which will be used later for browning the meat. But I'm going to put in here some water. I got a couple cups of water that will go in here that will regulate the temperature of the fat. Now that may seem kind of an odd thing to do to put water into fat. But remember we want this to be very low temperature so that it will completely tenderize this delicious brisket. Okay next thing that we're going to do is to put a couple of teaspoons of salt in here. The two teaspoons will be enough to give some nice flavor to this. So I'm going to sprinkle those around here like this. It will dissolve as this long slow cooking goes on. And then the pieces of meat. They should really be submerged in this cooking medium here. So get them in there. If they need to be cut up smaller then you can do that. Pull them out and cut them smaller. But once you get the meat in here I have one last thing to add to it. Now usually when people are making suadero as a commercial enterprise they're not just doing suadero in this. They're also going to be doing the little tripitas, the little tripes, the small intestines usually of the pigs. But they'll also be doing pieces of longaniza sausage. And that longaniza sausage will really flavor the fat that this is cooking in. This is all seeming really odd to you I know right now because you can't imagine having this thing. But hold on and I'm going to show you how you can actually do this really easily at home. But I wanted to show you what the real deal is. Just like this. Now we want there to be a little movement in the fat here. So like what I would call a very gentle simmer. And we're going to leave it here for about four hours or so to tenderize that meat that's in there. We may have to add a little bit more water from time to time to keep the level of the fat submerging the meat. But also to keep the fat at the right temperature. I've got this over about a medium low heat and that will usually be the right temperature. Now let's go back to what do you do. So I showed you that big piece of that cut of meat called a navel and said but you can do this with brisket. Also I showed you the chorizeta the classic way of doing it in Mexico. But I'm going to also show you that you can do this in a slow cooker. And that's probably what most of you are going to be choosing. So I have two cups of the fat here, the pork fat, just two cups. And I'm going to put a couple of teaspoons of salt in there. And then I've got the chorizo that I'm going to put in as well. Just scoop that in and then disperse it. This is out of the casing so I'm just dispersing it in that fat. And the cool thing is that where it takes about five cups or so of fat for me to do the chorizeta style, this one only takes two cups of fat. And now I'm going to just put all of this meat in here and then I'm going to nestle it. If you've seen the versions of carnitas that I do, I do one in the oven, I do one with that slow cook sous vide style, and then I do one in the slow cooker. And to tell you the truth, the slow cooker is my favorite version of all of that. You just nestle these guys down in here and we're going to put the top on it. And turn this guy on. I'm going to turn it. I've got it. Let's see here. And I've got it on high and this will cook for four hours. Same as what the chorizeta version of it would be. But no water in this one and just let it go. It's a closed container so it's going to cook just fine all by itself. No fuss, no muss. I'll meet you back here in four hours. Okay, it has been about four hours now. I can tell you that the smell here is just incredible because you get the beefiness, you get the fat. I mean, it's just like you want to eat. Your mouth is watering. So let's take a look and see what this is like here. Got a little steam there, but you don't really notice too much with what we're seeing in here. It's not like bubbling away or anything like that. But this meat should now be really super tender, like almost fall apart tender. But we're going to cut it into smaller pieces and then brown it. Now, when you go to a lot of places, especially in Mexico City, that's so famous for suadero, they will ask you, do you want it browned, dorado, or do you just want it straight? It's delicious straight out of this, of course, in the chorizeta that we've got working over here. It's got the same amount of time basically going, but you have to watch it more because you don't want it to just fry there. You want to kind of have it, keep it at about that little under 212 in temperature so that it's barely, barely cooking along and doing that very slow for this rather tough piece of meat. Okay, so since I like the dorado version of suadero, I'm going to cut this all up into pieces that are a little bit less than about half an inch. You'll notice as I'm cutting it here that it falls apart a little bit. So don't worry about that part of it. It's not going to be sort of perfect looking little cubes. So I've got to get through all of this. Okay, we've got all of this chopped up, sort of broken up here. I'm going to take a little of the fat that we cooked this in. By the way, you could strain this fat and you can store it to use to make really delicious beans. You could also use it to make more suadero. I'm going to take some of this. There's a little bit of liquid in there and I went pretty deep in there. All that liquid is gone now, but we need just enough of it to heavily coat the bottom of that. So I'm going to put all the meat in here. So if you're like a nerd like me and you actually own one of these chorizeros over here, let me just show you how you would do this if you want to give your friends and family that full, full experience. I'm choosing the most tender piece over here, taking it out of the fat and I'm going to cut that up. I'm not going to do all of it for you. I'm just going to show you how it would be done. Or if you're going to apprentice for being a street vendor, then this is what you would have to learn how to do. I'm going to take some of the fat here and put that up on the top of the dome there. And then we'll take the piece of the broken up piece there and then just let it brown up there. Because remember, your fire is right under this part of it. So you would do that. I'm going to come over here to this brisket and start just turning it around. You can see just how beautifully browned it is. That crunch, that browned crunch is my favorite part of suadero. And this is one of my favorite cuts of meat, even though it's probably not what the suadero is going to be made from when you have it in Mexico City, but it works just beautifully for this. And it's super accessible to you. This stuff over here, you'll start to see it browning up a little bit as I can turn these guys over here. Now the guys that make suadero tacos using a choricera like this would take the tortillas, the cold tortillas, dip them in a little bit of the fat, and then their domes are much bigger because this is a tiny little choricera, and they would just heat the tortillas up on that. I've got some warm tortillas because we're just about ready here. I don't like to brown this too much. I don't want to dry it out or anything like that. So I'm going to sort of build the taco for you here. Get rid of those guys back there. And my tortillas are already warm here. Let me take a look at these guys and see what we have. This is just exactly what I'm looking for, so I'm turning the heat off. And I'm going to put a couple of tortillas down here, and we'll build these beautiful suadero tacos for you. Okay, so meat on here. Nice crispy meat, beautiful, and it smells so good too. And now for this one, I like to have a bold salsa, so I've got the one that's made out of arbol and roasted tomatillo, but you could use any kind of salsa or hot sauce to put on here. But I'm going to spoon some of that over the meat. I think this taco is not completed unless you put onions and cilantro on it. And of course, you have to squeeze lime on this one because you've got all this rich and wonderfully fatty meat here. Okay, so because I have suffered through the smell of this for so long, I'm just going to dig right in."}, {"title": "My Breakfast Taco of Champions: Machaca con Huevos | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/di0AOB9RH38/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA4zWfyYRoTVxHJXL-y30yhg9Axag", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di0AOB9RH38&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=24&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Rustic, beefy, machaca, scrambled with eggs, there's really nothing better. Welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to machacado con huevo. Now this is a dish from northern Mexico, occasionally in the rest of Mexico you'll find it, but it really comes into its own. Up in the north, where there are lots of beef cattle and making of lots of beef jerky, because this is a shredded jerky and egg mixture that could just be eaten by itself, but my goodness it makes such great tacos. So let's go through it, because let's just face it, beef jerky from the northern part of Mexico may seem like a really odd thing. So if you go to your Mexican grocery store, you might find the shredded stuff, but most likely you're going to find homemade beef jerky, and that's what I have here coming from one of our local ones. If you get that, it's a lot more work to make it into this shredded jerky, but I'm going to show you the basics. I've got my broiler on here, and so I'm going to slide this jerky underneath the preheated broiler, and I'm going to watch it every 30-45 seconds or so, because I want it to get sizzling. I want it to brown just a little bit to kind of dry it out and crisp it up to make the shredding go easier. It's toasted now, and that really does help to make it much crisper, and then the pounding traditionally is either done in a molcajete or in actually a bigger kind of molcajete with a much bigger stone in it. You'll see that this gets kind of tedious. You need about a cup full of this stuff to make enough for four servings, so this could take some time. I'm going to tear it up into smaller pieces here and then just use the pestle of this right down on it, and what you'll see I'm looking for here is something that looks sort of fluffy. Okay there I have it, so what I want you to see in here is what this texture. It's much lighter in color and kind of fluffy looking. That's what you do if you don't have access to actually having it already done for you, and of course in Mexico you can find it everywhere already done like that, really fluffy in texture, and the great thing is you can find it online in the U.S. too, so you can just buy a package of this stuff, and it won't be as toasty as the other one is, partly because this is done in a mill rather than pounding it in a molcajete, so we have to toast it for the first part of our recipe. So I'm going to take about a cup full of this here, see how easy that is. And I'll tell you that I keep some of this jerky in my freezer at all times because it's such a great, quick, and really gutsy, beautiful breakfast. Okay, now that I've got my cup here, I am heating this pan over medium. It's a cast iron pan, so I'm going to give it a minute to get hot there, and then I've got to cut up all of these vegetables, classic vegetables, white onion, tomato, and green chili, and I'm going to cut them into small dice. I'm going to need about two-thirds of this onion here. I'm going to need about two-thirds of this onion here. Now the first step of working with the shredded jerky is to toast it in a pan with fat, and because this is such a great and rustic dish, I'm using fresh-rendered pork lard for it. You can use oil for it if you want. We need a fair amount of it here, about three tablespoons, and you'll see why in just a second. So I've got that there. This should be the good pork lard, not something that you buy in a little brick in the grocery store shelves. This one comes from a local butcher. Okay, so when that is completely\u2014I'm going to turn that just a little. I turned it down because I thought it might be getting too hot. We're going to take our cup full of the beef jerky that's shredded now, and we see just a hint of smoke coming off of that. It's all melted, and I'm going to put that in all at once. I like to do this toasting like this, stirring it constantly, and you'll see it sort of absorb all of the fat and then bubble up, and then it'll get this nice toasty smell to it. It doesn't take very long at all, and you don't want to burn it at this point at all. So then I'm going to scoop up now all of the veg that I have here, cut already. It smells super toasty, and this will stop the toasting part of it, and we'll put all of those vegetables in at one time. And then I'll stir it pretty regularly for about\u2014I mean, it'll probably take seven or eight minutes for all of the vegetables to get completely soft, and the whole mass will start to come together and look homogenous. Okay, this has been cooking for right at eight minutes, and you can see when I said it comes together as sort of a homogenous mass. That's what it looks like now. All of the tomato liquid has reduced, and it's just the seasoning in there. The onions are completely soft. I cracked eight eggs into this bowl while I was waiting for that to cook down. I'm going to salt them, but I'm going to salt them very lightly because, remember, this is salted beef here. That's the way they dry it, is to first slice it thin, then salt it, and then all through northern Mexico, you can just see it hanging out, air-drying. Okay, so I'm going to give this a light whisk. I like it to not be completely mixed whites and yolks, so we'll say that will go fine for that. And then I'm going to add it to the skillet here. Now, some people, and I could take this moment to say to you, some people would serve this just the way it is, not with the scrambled eggs, and you can feel free to do that as well. And then other people would look at this and go, that's not machaca at all, because machaca is made with boiled beef that's just shredded. And that is sort of the more modern way, but this is the classic way, and there is absolutely nothing that can stand in for the flavor of this shredded beef jerky like this. So in go the eggs now, and I will stir it until we get a nice scramble. I like it sort of soft. You'll cook it to your own specifications. I'm working in a very well-seasoned cast iron pan, but if you have a large or a very large nonstick, then you'll probably want to use that. I'm going to throw half of this cilantro that I chopped also while we were cooking down the machaca mixture. I'm going to put that in there, because that's just really delicious. I'm cooking all of this over medium heat, which is the way that I typically do it. There's so many arguments one way or another, high heat, low heat, medium heat for doing scrambled eggs, but this is a rich dish, so I can easily do this scrambling part of it over a medium heat. There's more to say about that, but we're almost ready here with this, so I'm not going to go into it right now. This looks pretty soft to me right now, so I'm going to let it go for just a minute more here on the heat. One of the things that people don't pay much attention to is carryover cooking. I just turned this pan off. It's just a little soft for me right now, but I'm going to let the pan, the heat of the pan, make this into the perfect stage of doneness for me. A couple of tortillas are going to go down here. It's often eaten with flour tortillas in the northern part of Mexico. Let's take a final look at this. That looks really beautiful here. I'm going to give it a taste as well. That amount of salt was perfect. I love machacado con huevo with a little bit of avocado, so I sliced up some avocado here and just finish this one off with a little more. I'm going to put a slice of avocado on each one of these tacos, like that, a little bit more cilantro. This is a spicy dish. I don't really find much of a need for a salsa for it, but you can make your own choices here. I put out a bottle of Mexican hot sauce, and I think that that could be a really nice addition to it. I put a little bit of serrano in here, so it's already spicy. This is, to me, my breakfast of champions."}, {"title": "A Michelin Star Taco at Home: Mochomos Tacos | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LTOFUx4lSaM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBPcpgcefJs_Aplb7ujVzFMQnBMbA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTOFUx4lSaM&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=25&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "You may never have heard of a crispy beef mochomos taco, but you'll never forget it. Welcome back to my kitchen. Now, the next page in this taco manual that we're creating takes us to mochomos tacos. It's a crispy beef taco, but outside of the northwestern section of Mexico, it's very little known. I fell in love with it when I visited that section years and years ago, and I started doing it on a restaurant menu, and everybody that ate it was just wild about it. So, I'm going to show you how to make those. The first thing that we need to do is to work with beef, and because this is crispy beef and we have to cook the beef first and then shred it, I choose a cut of beef that has really clear strings in it. Okay, so that would be flank steak. So, I'm starting with a three-quarter pound piece of flank steak, and I'm going to cut it in half against the grain. Okay, that's really important in this, and then I'm going to put that into a pan with four cups of water. That'll be just enough to cover it, so you don't really have to measure that if you don't want to. I'm going to put one slice of onion in here, but I'm going to need to grab another knife here because I cut meat with that one. So, I'm just going to put a slice of onion like that into the pot along with that, and then here's the hierbas de olor. Anyone that's been to a Mexican market in Mexico has seen little bundles of hierbas de olor, fresh bay leaves with fresh thyme and fresh marjoram. So, I'm going to put a little sprig of each of these and one or two bay leaves in there. I actually like to flavor this broth pretty highly there. A couple of teaspoons now of salt just to help with the seasoning as we're going through this, and then I'm going to bring this to a simmer, just a bare simmer, and let it go until the meat is really tender. That'll take an hour and a half to two hours. Okay, I'll admit it, this is the tedious part of this recipe because once the flank steak was really tender, I let it cool down in the broth, and then that just makes it easier to work with, and then started, chunk by chunk by chunk, peeling these into very thin shreds. You can see how it is. Now, I will tell you that in a lot of the markets in the northwestern part of Mexico, they're not quite this careful. You can imagine when we put these on the menu in our restaurant, nobody really wants them to be there because everybody has to gather around. So maybe you can gather around some people to help you to do the shredding of it. It goes faster as you work on it, as you start to get your rhythm with it here. I use my thumb in the middle of it and kind of just pull, pull, pull, pull, instead of trying to take them off one strand at a time. What you're seeing here represents quite a lot of work. I admit to that. We got a couple other things that we are going to make to go along with this. One is some crispy onions. You can leave them off, but if you're going to do the next step of this, which is deep frying, you might as well fry. This is one of my favorite parts of the mochomos tacos that we do in our restaurants. I'm going to fry up some very thin slices of onion because the sweetness is really lovely against the flavor of the mochomos. Okay, I'm calling it quits here with this. I've got one little funny piece over here, so I'm going to just set that to the side. Okay, now the mashed avocado that is going to go with this. I am going to do it very simply. This is not, I don't consider it guacamole, but a lot of people in Mexico would consider it guacamole because we are just going to use a spoon to scoop out. If I can grab hold of it there, scoop out the avocado into a bowl here, and then I'm going to mash that with some very simple seasonings. One of the seasonings that I'm going to put in there is going to be garlic, but I really dislike raw garlic in guacamole. The reason for that is that it starts taking over and within an hour or so the whole thing can taste a lot like garlic instead of avocado. I'm going to put this in here for one minute. That was two cloves of garlic that were covered in water, that's all. This is my quick way of blanching the garlic so it won't take over. I'm going to add to the avocado some salt and I'm going to add a little Mexican oregano to it. Some people would probably prefer to have some cilantro here, but a little bit of Mexican oregano crushed in there I think is really delicious. It makes it taste a little bit different than your typical guacamole would. And of course, just a little bit of squeezed lime juice. In fact, it's going to be so small I'm just going to squeeze it in just like this. Okay, now I'm going to mash this up with an old-fashioned potato masher because I want it sort of coarse. And now the garlic that is going to go in here. Remember that this is going to be hot. The bowl itself is going to be hot. We've blanched it. You open that door and right away you can smell the garlic in there. I'm going to take these guys out and I'm going to show you what the texture of them is. See they're like completely cooked garlic here. So slice it and then chop it up like that. I use the rock and chop method. Back and forth like this. And then we're going to toss that in. We'll come back to that and taste it in just a little bit. And then we'll move on to the crispy onions part of all of this. I'll just go right on top. We'll mix it in and taste it in just a minute. So now the onion, I cut a piece of it off earlier. But I'm going to cut this this way and then I'm going to start slicing it thinly this way. If you had one of those mandolins you could do this on a mandolin if you feel really comfortable doing thin slicing by hand. You could do that. That will be absolutely plenty for what we're going to need today. And I'm going to break all of the little pieces apart here and I'm going to salt it about I'm going to say not even a half a teaspoon will go on those there. And then coat them in flour just regular all all-purpose flour. It doesn't really matter because this is not for a baking recipe at all. But a nice coating of the flour on here. They shouldn't feel wet at all. They should feel quite dry. And now we're ready to go on to the frying. Okay so all of our hard work is just about to pay off. I have about an inch and a half of oil. Any kind of oil that you like to fry in. Some of you like canola. I like to use safflower oil that's for high heat. And so that's what I have at my house. About an inch and a half at 325 degrees. I can't emphasize enough that if you're going to fry things don't just wing it by guessing how the the heat of the of the oil. Get a digital thermometer like this one. I have one that's got a probe on it that is see I can look and see exactly what the temperature for the oil is. I've got this at 325 now. So this is going to be the first batch of stuff to go in here which is the onions. And that's at a lower temperature than we're going to fry the shredded flank steak. So you don't dump it in there all at one time. You kind of let them fall off of your hand into the hot oil. And my temperature has dropped about 10 degrees or so now. Okay and I'm going to let those cook until I am absolutely sure that the exterior of the onions has set. Meaning that little bit of liquid that came out of the onions from the salt and it mixed with the flour. And when I know that that has begun to set then I'm just going to toss these guys around in here. And I'm going to turn the temperature up just a little bit to bring it back to that 325 degrees. And then when they are beautifully golden I'll take them out with my little spider skimmer here and pile them onto paper towels. All right I've got some beautifully browned onions here. Yeah those look really nice. So I'm scooping those out kind of spread them a little bit out on the paper towels so that all of the fat anything that's on the outside will get absorbed. I want to make sure that I get all of it out of here because the next thing I'm going to do is to turn the temperature up to get to 350 degrees. So remember this was at 325. Oh those look gorgeous. Okay now I while they're still warm I am going to sprinkle them with a little bit of salt. That will help the salt to stick to them uniformly. Okay now let's see. Okay I'm at the right temperature here and I am going to start to fry the mochomos themselves. A big handful of it is what I'm going to put in here. And I'm going to do the same thing that I did with that with the onions. I'm just going to let it sort of fall down cascade down but you hear that it's sort of crackling. Now this won't take as long as the onions do to cook but you have to make sure that you cook them long enough that they're going to be crispy bits here. Now a lot of times when you go into the market they will use fryer baskets and just fill it up with that and they'll just crisp it all in. It's like a brick of these. We don't want that for this. We want to have beautiful sort of loose pieces of the mochomos. It makes it for a more elegant taco but you could literally put at least half of that in here all at one time and have it be a sort of brick that you break apart when you're making your tacos. Okay now take a look at this. Our beautiful little pieces of mochomos. And I will make sure that I get back I got to get five degrees more so that I put it in at about 350 and I will just continue to fry batches of the mochomos until all of it is done. Remembering to salt after it comes out so that the salt will evenly be absorbed into the meat. Now to build the taco. We have the avocado mash here. I'm just mixing in the blanched garlic to it but I need to give it a taste and see if I got enough salt in it. But man that little bit of Mexican oregano in there, little hint of lime juice, super good. Now I have a bold red chili salsa here. This one's made with arbol, roasted garlic, a little bit of guajillo chili, a little touch of vinegar. It's one of my favorites but man this stuff is super bold. So I'm going to add a little bit of lime juice and a little bit of guajillo chili. This is one of my favorites but man this stuff is super bold. So I'm going to build this taco the way that we do in our restaurants because we build them in a special way that ensures that every bite is a perfect bite. If you're going to go to all this work here to to make this then you want to make sure that it's good. A spoonful of the mash on each one of these tortillas here. I'm going to just spread it out because that's going to be the base that holds all of this stuff together. So spread the avocado mash on the bottom. Then this is sort of out of order or the way you think you would put a taco together but we put the salsa on next because I want to make sure that there's a little of that in every bite here. And then some of our crispy mochomos goes over that. Sort of pile that here and flatten it just a touch. Stuff is very beefy, crispy, delicious. Okay and now a bit of the crispy onions to go over the top of each one. And just because you we can gill this lily I'm going to put a little bit of chopped cilantro over the top of it and I'll tell you that may not be like any taco you've ever seen but that is a memorable mouthful."}, {"title": "Bacalao: A Christmas Treat, Perfect the Whole Year Round! | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kk0TqsNjhQE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAV93R-CRqoFUT7ggqD3DdcbczKOg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0TqsNjhQE&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=26&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Tacos de Bacalhau, now these will surprise you. Okay, I'm just finishing cutting some onions here for the next page in our taco manual, which is Tacos de Bacalhau. Now I know right away, some of you are going to say, that's a Christmas dish. You're only supposed to have it then, but I could take you to so many places in Mexico City and Veracruz where they make Bacalhau year round because it's just too good to relegate to just one time of the year. So for those of you that don't know what Bacalhau is, it's a salt cod dish. And the first thing that you got to do is to find the salt cod. Sometimes when you find Bacalhau in the market, it's in these little wooden boxes and the stuff is just hard as a rock. That's not really good quality Bacalhau. In Mexico, especially at Christmas time, you will find people selling big sides of Bacalhau, usually from Norway, but occasionally from Spain. And what they're telling you that you look for is a little bit of flexibility in it. It shouldn't be rock hard. And it's going to be coated in salt because obviously it is salt cod. So it's something that you can keep around for a long time. You don't have to worry about freshness except when it gets so old that it's rock hard. Okay. So the first step that you're going to do when you're making your Tacos de Bacalhau is to start the day ahead and put the salt cod into water. So I've got some soaking over here. I've changed the water three times actually in the last 24 hours, just so that when the salt soaks out, I can get rid of that salt, put fresh water on and soak more salt out. So we're just going to leave that there while we start the flavorings that go on in this. I've got a Dutch oven over here that's heated to about on over about medium heat. And I think there was a little bit of liquid in my olive oil because I poured something in there from an olive container. Okay. So now I've got that burnt off there and I'm going to put the onions that I chopped in there and we want to get those to lightly browned. And while that is browning there, first of all, of course you want to stir everything around so that the olive oil coats the onion. And then while that is browning there, I'm going to chop up this garlic. Okay. After I did the garlic, I chopped up a bunch of parsley as well. Parsley is really the thing that flavors this, not cilantro, kind of interestingly enough, because these flavors are really very Mediterranean in their origin. I pulled off all of the tough stems of the parsley before I started chopping, but the little tender stems I left in there. And now we're going to put some tomatoes in here. I find that this most consistently is made from canned tomatoes. A lot of times the fresh tomatoes that people use to make it actually, well, they're just not ripe enough to give you the color that you're looking for. So I usually rely on canned tomatoes and we're just going to blend that. Now you'll notice I didn't blend it very much because I still want some pieces in there that gives a really beautiful look to the tomatoes. These onions are not only really delicious smelling, but they're really beautifully browned here. I'm going to scoop up the garlic that I chopped earlier and I'm put it in here. My standard is that when garlic goes into the pot with the onions, the onion should basically be ready and you stir the garlic only the limited amount that it needs to release its aroma. I can already smell that beautiful garlic in there, but it usually takes a little, about a minute, maybe a little bit less. And then I am going to add to this pot those coarsely pureed tomatoes. And I'm going to turn up the heat a little bit here and then reduce this until it's almost the consistency of tomato paste. Okay, these tomatoes are almost cooked down to where I want them to be. That concentration will bring out sweetness and you're going to want sweetness to balance the flavor of the salt cod. While this is finishing, I'm going to take the soaked pieces of salt cod and put them into boiling water and I'm going to blanch them for about five minutes. This amount of time is not crucial, but it's just to bring out the last bits of the salt that was used to preserve the fish. So after five minutes, I will transfer that cod over into this tomato mixture. Cod has poached now. It shouldn't fall apart or anything like that, but you'll notice that it will give off a little bit of an odor of dried fish, which is also a nice thing to kind of blanch out of it at this point. And now I'm going to add all the other flavoring ingredients that are really classic in bacalao. I've sliced up some green olives, manzanillas are the main one that you will find used in Mexico, pickled jalapenos, buy a jar or can of them, cut them in half lengthwise, scraped out the seeds and then slice them lengthwise. Those go into the pot. We've got hierbas de olor, which are thyme, marjoram and bay that oftentimes is sold fresh in Mexico in bundles. I'm using some dried here and then we have that parsley that I've already chopped up and we're going to add now some water. This will take about a cup or so and I'm just going to stir all of that together. We want the consistency basically of marinara sauce. That's what we're looking for here. So everybody knows what that consistency is. So add water to hit that. And now I'm going to turn the heat down a little bit, put the top askew here. And now we're going to let this simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes until all of that cod starts to fall apart. This is smelling really delicious and what I need to show you is how the salt cod has now cooked enough that it's really flaking apart. So that's what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to flake it apart using this wooden spatula here. I want to break it up into fairly small pieces and that's not hard to do and doesn't really take very much time at all. But just break it up and then that will be the size pieces that are in your taco de bacalao. I think I've gotten most of it done here. While it was, while this was cooking, I chopped up a whole bunch of potatoes, those little red skin boiling potatoes. That's the sort of waxy texture that I really love in this kind of a preparation and potatoes and bacalao are really, really amazing together. So I am now going to put these potatoes in on top of it. Then I'll stir them together, put the top back on and let that cook for about 15 minutes or so just until our little small diced potatoes are completely cooked through. I'll meet you back in about 15 minutes. This is looking really good. I'm going to stir it a little bit just to bring everything together. It should hold its shape in a spoon. You should be able to stir through the pot and see the bottom of the pot. It's time to taste it now and see if it needs any salt. Now one thing that you have to know about this is that salt cod will still have retained some of its salt. So you don't want to over salt this. That's why I taste it and it's almost perfectly salted, just a tiny bit under. So I'm just going to sprinkle a little bit of salt over the top of it there. Stir that in and we're ready to make these delicious bacalao tacos. Okay, a couple of fresh tortillas here on the plate. And then I'm going to take some of the bacalao and pile that on. Now I like to add a little bit of extra spice to it, but not in terms of a salsa. This has all the salsa-like ingredients already in it and so we don't really need that at all. So I am going to put some of these pickled jalapenos over the top, absolutely one of my very favorite parts of all of this, and that will do the trick. And then we've got tacos de bacalao for any time of the year."}, {"title": "Handmade Flour Tortillas | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vPFRTBlkb_M/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAuko_0XazGHxLHT5xtg-ietI7EJQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPFRTBlkb_M&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=27&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Welcome back to my kitchen, and the next page in our taco manual is one of the most important because we've come to tortillas, and this time, flour tortillas. It might sound crazy coming from the guy that is such a huge proponent of corn tortillas, but in the northern part of Mexico, flour tortillas are a thing, and when they're homemade, they're ethereal. So let's step through the very, very simple method of making a good homemade flour tortilla. First of all, we're going to start with flour here. This is an all-purpose flour. The variety that I'm using has a little tiny bit of whole wheat mixed into it, which I like the flavor of. It comes from a local mill. The second ingredient that we're going to work with is the fat. Now, you'll find recipes online and in cookbooks that call for oil. Not a proponent of that. Vegetable shortening, it makes a kind of flaky tortilla. Still not a proponent of the flavor because what I learned when I was working in the northern part of Mexico doing all of my research was that the best ones are made with fresh rendered pork lard. Now, that's not the stuff that you buy on the shelf in the grocery store. You have to get this from the butcher's section or go to a really good butcher and ask for fresh rendered pork lard. That's what we work with in our restaurant, and so that's what I have here. I'm going to scoop all of this in, and this is a little bit like making pie dough, though I'm not working with really cold fat. I'm going to work this fat into the flour. I mentioned this thing about the the little bit of bran or the whole wheat that's in this flour just so that when you see that it has a little bit of color to it, you won't be sort of perplexed about that. Now, once I've worked this in, when you're making pie dough, oftentimes people will say to the size of small peas. This you're working in a little bit more, and we're not starting with a very cold fat here, so it will work in very quickly. Okay, so the next thing that we need to do is the liquid, which in tortilla making, flour tortilla making, will be very hot tap water. So I'm going to go to the sink and get this hot tap water, three quarters of a cup of it here. Yep, and I am going to measure in about three quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Now, this is up to your own taste. I kind of like salty tortillas when it comes to flour tortillas, so I'm going to put in almost a whole teaspoon of it there, but three quarters of a teaspoon is a good amount, and then I'm going to pour in a half a cup of this hot tap water, leaving behind about a quarter of a cup of that. I've got a fork here to start mixing it, and you'll see that right away this, the liquid is absorbed by the flour, and then you'll notice that I'm just kind of mushing it up against the side to try to incorporate as much of the flour into the dampened dough as possible there. Okay, that's about as much, I think, as I can get in there, but I still don't have all of the flour incorporated, so around the outside of this bowl where the unincorporated flour is, I'm going to pour, I know it's going to take about all the rest of that, so now using my hands to mix this nicely together. If you're working with really good fresh rendered pork fat like I am, man, this smell is so great. It smells like you're making flour tortillas with a little bit of the flavor of roasted pork in it. That's the one thing I like about Mexican pork lard, is that it is done over high heat, not low heat, so the idea is to get a lot of that really delicious, delicious roasty flavor into it. Okay, so it is now basically all incorporated. You can see I've got just a little bit of it left down here in the bottom, but I'm going to incorporate that just simply by putting it on top here and then work it like that. Okay, so very simple dough, just incorporate everything. Pretend it's a little bit like bread dough at this point, and just give it a few kneads, not too many, but you want a smooth dough at this point, and then you want to cut it into 12 pieces. This is going to make a dozen tortillas, so to make that go smoothly, I'm going to roll it into a log, a sort of even log here, and then using a bench scraper, cut it in half, and then each half into half again, and again, and then let's cut these things into, let's see, we've got four or three pieces, so like that, and then each one of these needs to get rolled in balls. If you've done much in terms of baking before, you know that the easiest way to roll these into balls is to have them in the palm of your hand and roll like that, cupping around it, and it will make a perfect little ball like that. When you watch people working in bakeries, that's a way, like in Mexico, it's the concha makers that use this technique all the time, and when we get our 12 here, then we just let them rest for about half an hour before we start rolling them out. Okay, here are the rested balls of dough. I covered them with plastic wrap, left them at room temperature, and the rolling out is pretty straightforward. This is the kind of rolling pin that's typically used in Mexico. I bought this in northern Baja, no, excuse me, southern Baja, where people make a lot of flour tortillas. Now, you want to work on a floured board. I will say that this kind of technique for lightly flouring the surface is the one that's used by all of the bakers. I like to actually kind of toss this guy in the flour a little bit just to get it started there. Flatten it out a little bit like that. You don't want too much flour on your board because that flour will become incorporated into this flour tortilla, and it'll actually make it taste floury, so stay away from that. Here we go, rolling out. I use the technique to roll away from me, not back and forth, and I turn about a quarter of a turn each time that I'm rolling the flour tortilla out. This is a very malleable dough, very easy to work with, and when you get to about six inches, which is the size for these flour tortillas, you'll go to a griddle that you have already preheated. So I've got this one over about what I would call a medium-high fire, so I'm going to pick this guy up, and it's pretty evenly rolled. I'm just detecting a tiny bit more thickness on one side there. Okay, so now you pick this guy up, and I'm going to put it on this preheated, medium-high griddle, and we'll just lay it down. No fat or anything on the surface of this. These will not stick. This is kind of what I'd call a classic flatbread from any place in the world. It's not as complicated as like the Indian paratha, which has many layers in it, and it's very flaky, but this is going to come out quite flaky too, but it's because of the fat that we have in it. Now you'll notice that all of a sudden it starts to bubble. When it starts to bubble like that, it's probably getting some browning going on underneath, so I'm going to flip it over. See the little browned edges all around there, and we're going to cook it for another like 30 seconds or so on the this side. I usually, just like in making corn tortillas, I flip my flour tortilla another time. You don't have to, but I'm just sort of used to doing that, but it gives a little bit more flakiness when you do that after this 30 seconds or so on the second side. So of course, see how beautiful that is, and it's puffing even more because I flipped it the second time. The more puffiness that you get, usually these won't go all the way to pita bread puff, but the more puffiness that you see there, the better the flakiness and the better your experience with the tortilla will be. Okay, so I've got what I think is one of like the best flour tortillas in the world, just really because it's flavored with that fresh rendered pork lard there, and when I tear it open like this, you can see just how incredibly flaky it is. See all that flakiness there, and you'll see some sort of darkish spots. That is because it has a certain amount of fat in it that makes it really flavorful, really tender. You got to make these flour tortillas."}, {"title": "Three Agaves in One Margarita: Topolo 2.0", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wXYlgPF3d8I/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBXpkP2SABTRFZMjXcoBMQbaGAm5g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXYlgPF3d8I&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=28&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "My guess is that you have heard about Sotol. If you haven't, then listen carefully because you're going to start hearing a lot about it. Yes, it's a type of agave spirit. At least we lump it in with agave spirits. So the most famous agave spirit, of course, is tequila. And then everybody started getting really into mezcal. And now what you're hearing about is Sotol. So Sotol is made in the northern part of Mexico, primarily in the state of Chihuahua. And it is made with a plant or from a plant that before was called an agave, but now has been declassified from the agaves and put into the lily family. There's a lot of relationship between those two groups. So when they talk about it in English, usually we call it desert spoon plant. And it looks to the naked eye like a type of agave, but a little smaller. And the crazy thing is it blooms every year. But first of all, we have to talk about what is its flavor because it's quite distinctive. It doesn't smell like it's a tequila. It doesn't smell smoky at all like a mezcal. In fact, when I smell it, the first thing I think about is lots of green herbs. So whatever you put it in or just drink it by itself, you're going to get that green herb quality coming through really loud and clear. So what I'm going to do right now is to turn it into my favorite, my current favorite, margarita that we call the Topolo 2.0 because our restaurants are famous for the Topolo margarita. Now we have a Topolo 2.0 that includes both mezcal and Sotol. So let me show you how to make that. I'm going to start, well, first of all, I've got some ice here in a shaker and I'm going to start here with one ounce of a Blanco tequila. I'm using Espolon because it's priced right. It's a good quality and it's priced right for doing mixed drinks with margaritas. Okay, now we're going to go to half ounces of everything else until we get to the lime juice, but we're going to go half ounce of Sotol going in here, then a half ounce of mezcal. And I'm using one of my current favorites from the state of Puebla. This one is called Ojo de Tigre. Next, we're going to put the orange liqueur in, but this time I am using a Cura\u00e7ao, a really good quality Cura\u00e7ao. And the half ounce of that will go in here. Half ounce of simple syrup. This is a one-to-one simple syrup. You'll notice that it's kind of a golden color. That's because we use organic sugar to make it. And then three quarters of an ounce of this beautiful, fresh, squeezed lime juice. Top on, shake that up. You're going to get the brightness of the Blanco Tequila, the slight smoky complexity of the mezcal, the herbal qualities out of that Sotol. Of course, the sweet elements like the Cura\u00e7ao and the simple syrup will round it all out. And then we'll strain that into a coupe that has a beautiful salted rim, which will bring out all of those flavors. I hope you like this as much as I do.

It is a Yucatan beef salad taco. This stuff is really good. The next page in our taco manual is going to take us to the Yucatan Peninsula to a dish that is not very well known outside that region. It's called Zik, a D-Z-I-K, and in olden days it was made with venison that was hunted around there. There's not really any venison left there, but the venison was cooked in a pit in the ground, so they called it venado pibil or venison pibil, so you know cochinita pibil is cooked in a pit in the ground, and it was the same kind of dish, except that they would take that meat out and shred it and mix it with all kinds of fresh vegetables and serve it as a cool room temperature taco filling. You're gonna love this for the warm weather because it's really, really satisfying. So we're stepping aside from the venison and we are going to go to another meat, beef, but one a cut that is very, very easy to shred and shred really beautifully. So I have flank steak in front of me. That's what I would choose for this, and the first step here is to cut this into pieces. I'm going to cut this little tail piece off here. Cut this into pieces that are about two inch squares, so you don't have to be exact with this, but someplace in the neighborhood of two inch squares, and we're going to put it into some boiling water. I think I'll just throw this little piece of tail in there as well. I'm going to cut half of this red onion now and put that down in there. We've got a couple cloves of garlic. These are small or one big clove. A couple of bay leaves and then the other things that go with bay leaf always in Mexico are marjoram and thyme. That makes the bundles that they call hierbas de olor in the markets in Mexico. That's going to go in there, and then I am going to put a teaspoon of salt. I'm going to measure that. A teaspoon of salt here into this water. We are going to partially cover it and then let this just coast along at a gentle simmer for an hour to an hour and a half, and that's going to give us some really beautifully tender meat. That's what we have to have for this, so it's got to be easy to shred, but I'm going to let it cool in the broth because it'll give you the juiciest meat. I will meet you back here in a couple of hours because we've got to let this stuff cool off. Now while this meat is cooling here, I'm going to do all the chopping that we have left. We've got some habanero chilies. We've got red onion, tomato, some farmer's market radishes that are rather large there, and cilantro. I'm just going to chop all those things into small pieces and put them on this plate here. So okay, time to shred this. Now this of course takes a little bit of patience because I will tell you that the finer the shreds on this, the better the salad will be. If you pull it off in great big hunks, then it's going to not be the same kind of distribution of the meat through the salad. So from my experience, the best zik is always the one with the finest shreds. So I'm going to be here for a little bit shredding the meat. Ready to mix all of this together. You'll notice that I've cut everything very fine, especially that habanero. Now it's one to two habaneros depending on your heat tolerance, but this is the fruitiest, most delicious chili. So I would push it just a little bit if I were you. It's also supposed to be a sort of spicy beef salad, if you will. So we've got everything ready to go in here. I'm just going to scoop it all off of the plate here and in, and then I'm going to add to that a teaspoon and a half of salt. There's no salt hardly in anything and when you taste that meat, you'll notice that even that teaspoon of salt that I put in to the broth didn't really penetrate the meat very much at all. So I'll put that on there and then we have a generous one third cup of lime juice, always freshly squeezed, and we will mix this all together. Now if that doesn't satisfy as a great summer salad, I don't think anything will. But I also have to say when you think of it wrapped in a warm corn tortilla, it's even better. It's just so delicious and it's one of the things that I like about tacos in the Yucatan Peninsula is that they do a lot of room temperature fillings in warm tortillas and I think that combination is just really magical. Okay, so we've got that there. I've got an avocado that is ready to cut. What I'm going to do here is to cut around the pit, twist the two sides apart now, and then I'm going to make some slices here. I just need four slices because I'm going to show you something that's a little bit different, a little out of the norm for our taco manual. And I'm going to take two tortillas and lay them on our serving platter here. And then I'm going to lay a couple of these little gym lettuces here because sometimes you have guests that are just not into the tortillas perhaps or carbohydrates or whatever but this will certainly be something good for them to use the little lettuce pieces there. I never tasted this so I want to... Tangy, crunchy, super refreshing. Okay, now I am going to move this guy back over here and take some of this cool beef salad, go there and here. Our little gym lettuce, we'll get a small amount there as well. And then we're ready to put this avocado on there. You'll notice that I sliced it in such a way that the rind still stayed on it. So we'll put these slices over each one, that'll add a really beautifully creamy note to it. And then, as I like to just put a few leaves of cilantro over the top. You don't really need to do that for color on the little lettuce wraps that I've made there so I'm just going to use these on the tortilla version. And there you've got it. This is tacos de Zeke, a Yucatecan beef salad that's perfect for the summertime."}, {"title": "Tacos Gobernador, Tacos fit for a Governor | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g3xXUR5_QuU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLC-Zv_egifHUxrcJUgVZKQ8oRWrWg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3xXUR5_QuU&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=30&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Tacos Gobernador. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a The next page in our taco manual is gonna take you to something that I think you're really going to love. It's called Tacos Gobernador, Governor's Tacos. Now, this was something that was developed back in the 80s in the state of Sinaloa. They say it comes from a restaurant called Los Arcos that wanted to create something special for a visit of the governor. Well, since that time, and I don't know if that story is completely accurate, but since that time, this Tacos Gobernador has really taken off. And it's morphed into many different varieties. I'm gonna show you what I think is the most classic and tell you a little bit about some of the variations that I've discovered as we go along. But the first thing that we have to do is to understand really what this is. Okay, so it's really Machaca de Camaron or a machaca made out of shrimp, which sounds like a very luxurious thing to do, except that they have so much shrimp there that they're always trying to find ways to use it up. So they just chop up the shrimp and they cook it with basically the ingredients. They go into a pico de gallo, already sounds really good. And then they make it into these tacos that are sort of crispy on the outside with melted cheese on the inside. Sounds a little bit like a quesadilla. We're gonna make it with corn tortillas. You could make it with flour tortillas if you want. And people do both of those things in this region of Northern Baja in the state of Sinaloa. The first thing that I gotta do is chop up all those ingredients that would be part of the pico de gallo. And then I have to chop up the shrimp. So let's get to work. Okay, clearly the heavy lifting in this recipe is all of the chopping because the filling really goes together very quickly. We're gonna start by putting a little bit of butter into this large skillet here. You could use oil for this if you wanted to. I just like the versions that have the butter in it because I think it balances with all of the other flavors really well and then marries to the cheese. First thing that's gonna go in here is going to be raw poblano. You almost never see me do that. But this dish is always made with raw poblano. I have a bunch of serrano that I cut up here as well. And that serrano will go in just a little bit. I like the little extra kick that that gives it. But we're gonna start by saut\u00e9ing here the onion and the raw poblano that I quartered lengthwise and then sliced very thinly. I'm gonna get my temperature to about medium here now and then cook this until it's softening. That'll take about seven minutes or so. This garlic is gonna go in, but just for a minute, just until you can smell it really beautifully. It releases its aroma. We don't wanna burn it. That would make this a really bitter preparation. And now we're gonna put in the chili, that little bit of serrano chili, and the chopped tomato. And we're gonna let this cook for a little while until the tomato has completely softened and this mixture looks like it's kind of coming together. Okay, this is really looking like a mixture that's coming together because the tomato has completely softened in here. So in go the shrimp. That only took a couple minutes. And then we are going to stir this around over the same kind of medium heat here. I like to do it in a big wide pan like this, a very large skillet, because everything will cook evenly and it will cook quickly. If you have a smaller skillet than this, it's gonna take you longer, but usually with this chopped shrimp in a heavy pan like this, it'll only take a couple of minutes, two to three minutes for it to turn from that translucent look to a kind of milky white. Okay, now the extra little flavor booster, and that's Worcestershire sauce, about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Lots of recipes don't call for this, but I will tell you that it just boosts flavor. Think of that as your secret ingredient. Now, when that is pretty much just completely evaporated in the pan, I'm gonna give you the second of my flavor boosters, and that's tomato paste. We have the fresh tomato in here, but I'm gonna put in just a big heaping tablespoon of tomato paste. I like to buy it in the tube because I never use very much of it at any one time. That's gonna boost the color, but it's really gonna boost the flavor in this. So the Worcestershire sauce and that little bit of tomato paste is gonna really, really enhance the flavors here. Of course, we've got a couple of other flavor enhancers. I've got some chopped cilantro that I'm gonna stir in here, and at the same time, I'm gonna put in about a teaspoon of salt, a generous, generous teaspoon of salt because I know what it's going to need. Just a little bit more there, and we will stir this until it's dry, and the filling is made. A couple of tortillas here. These are homemade ones, and so they're a little bit thicker than the ones you would purchase at the store, but I will tell you the ones at the store are just fine for this preparation. And again, I will say that you can use the flour tortillas, but you don't coat those. You don't brush those with oil. I'm gonna just do a couple of them to show you here, and I'm gonna put them, the oiled side down on a hot griddle here, and then we're gonna cover them with some cheese, some melted cheese, or it's going to melt here. It's not melted. It's just shredded cheese right now. So you put about that much of it on there. That'll be about a third of a cup for each one of these. These are cheesy, and the hot filling, it doesn't have to be hot. You can make this ahead of time and then just work with it. Though I will tell you that if you don't warm it up at least to room temperature, it'll take too long for it to heat up here. So I'm gonna put a portion of it on one side like that, and then use my spatula here to fold over. Okay, you wanna see that cheese start melting. Now, and some of the filling and some of the cheese will inevitably end up on your griddle. If you don't have a big griddle, then you could do all of this in a large skillet, same size skillet as that, and you just wanna fold them over like that, and then we're just gonna turn them here for a couple of minutes until they start to crisp up. Now, these will never be crispy like deep fried taco shells, nothing like that, but they will crisp and they will color a little bit, and it just makes them so attractive and so absolutely delicious. I'm just gonna turn them for those couple of minutes while they continue to crisp. Okay, they're crunchy and delicious looking. The little bits of cheese that have come out and crisped on the griddle. Man, that stuff is so, so good. Okay, there we go. And now I'm ready to eat.

So I have already started the preparations of this. I'm using the orange habaneros in the Yucatan Peninsula. They use the green habaneros just as much as they use the orange ones. So if you find the green ones in your farmer's market, you can make this exact salsa with it. It's going to be a greener kind of flavor. This is a little sweeter. That one's a little bit brighter. Okay, so we've got dry roasted habanero chilies without their stems on them and three garlic cloves here roasted in their papery husk. Now we got to get that papery husk off of them now before we make the salsa. This is a very, very simple salsa, but I will tell you it's not only one of my favorites. I think it is one of the glories of the Mexican kitchen. So once you have roasted the garlic, it will separate from that papery husk, but you want to make sure you roast the garlic long enough that the clove inside is really soft. It should be completely soft. If yours is not, it needs some more time. It takes about 15 minutes or so. I'm going to put the garlic cloves now into the blender, then scoop up the roasted habaneros and put them in their seeds and all, because at this point after you've roasted them, there's no reason to take the seeds and veins out. That capsaicin, the hot part, is just all over the chilies. I'm going to add to it four tablespoons of water, two tablespoons of lime juice, and I'm going to measure in a half a teaspoon of salt. Then we're going to put the top on and we're going to make a puree out of this. So here's the lesson to learn. Habaneros are incredibly spicy. All capsaicin is volatile into the air if you put it in a blender. So when you take the top off of this, you actually have to stand back or you might be choking. Let's do it. So pull that off. I'm standing way back and I'm going to show you what the texture of this is now. So I've got a little salsa dish here and I'm going to pour it in. It should be at least this thin. Some people will make this kind of roasted habanero salsa even runnier than that. Now you've got to taste it. That is always the trick. So you don't just take a big spoonful of this stuff because people don't even put big spoonfuls of it on their food. You take a little bit like that. I always just dab it on the back of my hand. This is sort of kitchen culture from Mexico. And that one little dollop there. I will taste. So not only is it hot, it is incredibly delicious because there's so much fruitiness there. The salt that's in there is just right. The lime juice just perks everything up and the garlic, the roasted garlic mellows everything out. That stuff is pure gold."}, {"title": "Frijoles Refritos - (Don't Call 'em Re-Fried) Beans | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sm-E36ROnDo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBGiwyYzW1qQIwypWkGT69ehmeSmA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm-E36ROnDo&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=32&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Let me show you how to make the perfect frijoles refritos. Hello everybody and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to what I consider to be the most important accompaniment to go with all these beautiful tacos that you guys are making out there. So let's talk about frijoles refritos. Fried beans, well fried beans, or what a lot of people call them refried beans. There's nothing re about them. Re is a prefix in Spanish that just means done really well. So that's why I often call them well fried beans. First we got to talk about beans and how you cook them or what you buy. So let's talk first about how you cook them. Here I've got one pound of small black beans. That's a generous two cups. Sometimes if they're bigger beans it'll be like two and a half cups if you're using pintos or some of the red beans or something like that. But you can use any kind of bean that appeals to you. I love black beans so that's what I'm doing here today. Okay so the first thing you do is rinse them off and you pick over them for some rocks. Most of the beans that we get today are very clean so you're probably not going to find any of that debris in the beans. And then you cook them in one of basically two ways. You're going to be on the stovetop or you're going to be in a pressure cooker. So for one pound of beans you're going to put two and a half cups of liquid if you're cooking it on the stovetop. If you're doing it in my handy dandy instant pot pressure cooker here you're going to put two quarts of water just a half a quart less because there's no evaporation there. And then you're going to bring everything to a simmer and you're going to simmer or pressure cook one hour in the pressure cooker two hours more or less on the stovetop. Very low heat barely a simmer to let these guys go. Should you soak your beans overnight? And that's up to you. They don't do it in Mexico. You don't have to do it. They will cook quicker. And a lot of times people will say that if you pour off the liquid and start with new liquid after soaking them overnight they'll be more digestible. The truth of the matter is beans will be more digestible if you eat more beans. Plain and simple. People don't talk about digestibility in countries where they eat a lot of beans but we don't eat them much in the United States so we have to deal with that issue. So now we've got our finished beans here. If you're doing it in the pressure cooker then just let it go off and naturally reduce that steam over the next 20 minutes or so but don't do a very quick release of the steam. Okay we've got our cooked beans here on stovetop. Oh I put this clay one over here because someone gave me that as a beautiful piece of very traditional stovetop bean pot. There are many different styles of these all over Mexico and maybe you travel to Mexico you go to a market you see one and you want to bring that back. They will impart a really beautiful earthiness to the flavor of the beans. Okay now we need to look here and see what the consistency of these beans is here. So we've just got enough of the juice to just barely cover them. That's where we want to start. You will have about six cups of beans here. Something let's say about seven cups of beans. So this is the point at which we have to stop and say okay I'm never going to be doing my beans from scratch so talk to me about what I can buy in a can because canned beans are perfectly perfectly fine. So they are coming now in cans as well as pouches. Usually 15 ounces in each one of those and they won't have as much juice as this but for this recipe to equal about a pound of beans the pound of dry beans that we started with you'll need about three cans or three pouches. You could go three and a half four if you wanted to for this same recipe that I'm making now but I'm basically basing it on a one pound of dried beans recipe here. Okay next thing that I have to do I've cooked these without any salt. Most people will tell you to do that but there are people who will definitely say that's not the way to go put the salt in from the very beginning. You'll have to decide I'm kind of split on it. I've done it both ways and I can't tell a lot of difference but these don't have any salt in them. So I'm putting two heaping teaspoons of this flake salt in there. I'm going to let that cook in with them because it takes a little while for the beans to absorb that salt. I'm going to let that cook while I do my prep for the next stage for making the frijoles refritos. I'm going to chop up this onion and I'm going to dice the or I'm going to very finely mince the garlic for this recipe. Okay all of these vegetables are prepped now and now's the moment that we talk about fat. So you can use anything that you want fat wise to make your frijoles refritos. Anything from vegetable oil that will give it a neutral kind of flavor to the fresh rendered pork lard. I'm going to encourage you not to buy the hydrogenated stuff that you find on the grocery store shelves. It doesn't have it's it's harmful to you but it also doesn't have any flavor. So fresh rendered pork lard or what I'm going to be using today which is really my absolute favorite here and that is bacon drippings the fat from cooking bacon. Now the quantity that you're going to use here is about a quarter of a cup. That's what you're looking for but I will say that there's a lot of controversy as to how fatty these should be. In some places in Mexico they like lots of fat in them. In other places they like them to be a little bit leaner and soupier. So you're going to have to figure out your way through all of this. I've got this now over about a medium high heat just to start here and then I'm going to add all of the chopped onion. We're going to cook that until it completely softens and starts to brown. Browning to me is key here for developing flavor and then we'll add our garlic for a minute or so and start to add the beans to it. Okay, we are ready to start now adding the beans to this. I'm going to turn that fire off completely and then bring the beans a little closer here and with a slotted spoon start to add them to this pan. I'm doing it with a slotted spoon so I'm not getting any of the juice right now. I will add that a little bit later but I'm going to use the old-fashioned potato masher to do my mashing. I will tell you that it works really beautifully if you live near a Mexican grocery store or travel to Mexico a lot then you can buy the bean masher in those places but this old-fashioned potato masher works just as good. Now you have to make the decision as to what you're going to do for consistency here. If you were in Oaxaca, you would have put these beans straight into a blender jar and made a pasta, as they would call it, out of it, a paste out of it. I like the frijoles refritos to have some texture so I don't really work them in here and you'll notice that I like a lot of onions and garlic in the frijoles refritos. You could do less if that suits your taste. Okay now we've got these all nicely mixed in here so now I'm going to put the rest of the beans in. I usually do it in a couple, three different additions just so that I get started with the beans. Now of course if it's easier for you to pour these beans into a colander set over a bowl then you've got your finished beans without the liquid then but I think I've got just about where I want there and just a little bit more time mashing and we're going to be done. Now you may think that this is a lot of frijoles refritos and I would agree with you but they freeze beautifully. I don't usually make anything less than a whole pound of dried beans at a time but of course you could scale this recipe down if you want to. They freeze beautifully, they're great to have in the refrigerator for a week or so. One of my favorite, I'm going to call it light meals slash snacks, is to heat a tortilla up, smear it with black beans, put queso fresco over it and add a little salsa. It's just, or even Mexican hot sauce, it's just so good and it's so good for you as well. So I'm getting to the point where I like the texture. You'll notice that you'll see whole beans still in here, a few whole beans in here but I really like this kind of a texture for it. Now one thing that you have to know, well a couple things you might have to know. Number one is when I was cooking these beans you saw that I had it partially covered. If you don't have it covered then the liquid will evaporate too fast. Just check every 15-20 minutes or so while you're boiling beans, or simmering beans I should say, that the liquid is still above the level of the beans and if you see beans peaking up add a little bit more hot water to it so it comes right back to a simmer and now that I've got these cooked to this stage they're perfect to smear on a taco before you put your filling on there but I will tell you these will thicken up super fast. So you want your beans to be runnier, juicier. So I'm going to pour actually all of this, all this juice because I only have like about a cup full in there. I'm going to put that all in there and stir it in. It'll loosen them up really fast but then I can let this simmer for a little bit more or as they cool a little bit I can just wait for them to naturally thicken. Okay, let's put that over there, towel down there. I'm going to move these beans over in front of you here and I will tell you that's the way I like to serve them when I'm serving tacos. I leave them in the skillet that I cooked them in. This is a beautiful cast iron skillet. This one has the added advantage that I can put this top on it like that and keep them warm for quite a long time because cast iron holds heat really beautifully and then when it comes time to serve I can either return them to the heat and give them a little boost or I can, if they're still warm, just uncover them and let everybody help themselves. I hope this helps you when you're planning to serve tacos to know a few things about serving frijoles refritos with them because it's an absolute magical accompaniment."}, {"title": "Easy Pickled Red Onions, Perfect for Cochinita Pibil | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nLColhkisbY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBn0OfA7UhP5m7EmSS1PL3QrPkdng", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLColhkisbY&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=33&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Pickled red onions, the absolutely perfect accompaniment to go with cochinita pibil, that really savory pork dish from the Yucatan Peninsula. Very easy to make. I have sliced two red onions. Come on around with me and I'm going to show you the next step, which is to put hot tap water. Now I hope you have really hot tap water like I do in my house because if you don't you might want to actually bring this, not quite to the boil, but a little bit underneath it. I have very hot tap water so I'm going to cover these with the hot tap water and just let them sit for about 30 minutes. What that does is to take the power out of the onion, so it's that step called desflamando in Spanish, but it also changes their texture just a little bit. At the end of 30 minutes I'm going to drain them. All of that hot tap water comes off. You want to get a lot of it off, okay? Don't leave any at the bottom. And then I'm going to put on some lime juice. This is fresh squeezed lime juice and we will need, so you need a fair amount of it, we need enough to cover the onions. Just barely cover them. Yeah, just like that. Okay, now I'm going to put one teaspoon, a measured amount, of salt in this. I'm going to mix it in with my hands because that's the most efficient way to get it in here and then I can pack these onions back down like that into the bowl covering them all with the lime juice. Set these aside for about six hours or so for the pickling to happen and I'll meet you back here when that's ready. Look at those beauties. Now I put these into the refrigerator because these are lime pickled, not vinegar pickled. I usually would pack them into a storage container and then they'll last for a couple of weeks, but because they're lime pickled, these are not going to last as long as the vinegar version, but they're more delicious."}, {"title": "Bring a Mexican Favorite Home with Beef Tongue Tacos with Tomatillo Salsa | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/814MQjTjnfU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBEXRRW4qWdPZUPI1x_g3WVaYByxw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=814MQjTjnfU&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=34&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Our next page in the taco manual takes us to the iconic Tongue Tacos. Now, before you just click away from this, I'm going to say, bear with me, because if you can't imagine having tongue, I'm going to entice you to do that. I take people to Mexico all the time, and when we go to Taquerias, I always order Tongue Tacos for them. And to tell you the truth, it's usually their favorite thing. Why? First of all, because it's really good. It's really, really rich meat. It doesn't taste gamey like other innards might taste at all. In fact, it's just got one of the most delicious textures of any meat that comes off of that animal. Okay, so let's just go through this. I'm going to give you an easy way and a regular way. Okay, easy way is to go to a deli. I'm going to just reach over here and grab this and buy smoked tongue. Okay, sometimes it will be peeled, sometimes it won't. If it's got the skin still on it, then just cut that off. But buy a chunk that's about one and a quarter pounds. That will get you started in this process, and you can have tongue without having to go through the cooking process. If you go to a Mexican grocery store, you will always find tongue there. I think always. And you can go to other butchers, and they can order one for you if they don't carry it in their stores. But this is what a medium-sized one will look like. It's about two and a half pounds or so. Now I'll tell you three different ways to cook it because it's a tougher cut that yields very beautifully to long slow cooking. So think about a slow cooker. It'll take about eight hours or so in a slow cooker. You can also just simmer it on the stove top. There it'll probably take about three hours to get really tender. If I were you, I'd put a small knife in there, twist it a little bit, and make sure that it's really tender. Or I know a lot of you have pressure cookers like the electric instant pot. An hour and a half, 90 minutes in this will be perfect for doing the tongue. That's what I'm using to show you this process today. So I said you simmer it in water to cover. And you know what I put in here is an onion sliced up, say four cloves of garlic. You might want to cut them in half so that they yield more of their flavor. A little thyme, bay, and a couple teaspoons of salt. That's what I put in here. Nothing fancy. Now I've cooked this one and let it cool down until it's handleable now. So I'm going to take the tongue out of here and show you what that looks like when it's ready. Okay it comes up like this. This is the place where everybody will go oh because yes it is a tongue. It looks like a tongue. Get all the little pieces of onion and some of the herbs off of that. And then I've got it over here on some paper towels like this so that I can kind of pat it dry. Now you want to do the cleaning of it when it is still slightly warm. I mean obviously I've let this cool down till I can touch it and hold it. But you want to strip this skin off of it. So you pull that like that and it just comes off. And it should come off pretty easily like that. Now this is very tender tongue and that's exactly what you're looking for because that will make the end result really really wonderful. Wonderful. Okay now I think I've got some more of the skin to strip off on this side like that. And then two places you want to look. This one was trimmed really tightly on this end. So usually if they're not trimmed very much you'll just put your hands there and feel some cartilage. Some sort of bony cartilage. I don't feel any there so I'm not going to cut that off. This part that's kind of fatty at the base here I usually take that part of it off though it's not only the fatty parts of it if you feel like that that is necessary for you. One little errant piece of the skin right there and then I'm going to cut this up into pieces that will fit nicely in a taco. Now I'm starting back here on this end because I want to make sure that I don't have any of that bony cartilage in there. So cut there and then I'm going to cut each one of these slices into smaller pieces and then we're going to brown that. Now my favorite place to go for tongue tacos in Mexico City is a place that's called Cucullos and they have the already cooked tongue that they fry until it's kind of crispy and that's the direction that I'm taking this one because I want to show you what I think is the best way to serve the tongue. The tongue because it's a very rich piece of meat and it is quite soft at this point I want to crisp it up so I'm just turning each of these pieces of sliced tongue now into small cubes. So to crisp up the tongue I'm putting a very large skillet this is a cast iron skillet over about a medium high heat and we're going to just let that heat getting it really hot before we put the the meat in there and while we're waiting for that to heat up I'm going to make this salsa. Now typically a salsa verde one made from tomatillos is going to be the perfect combination with the richness of this meat because it's tangy tangy and you've seen me make a roasted tomatillo salsa before you've seen me make an all raw tomatillo salsa before but in this one I'm going to combine those two because I want the crunchy freshness of the one that's made with raw tomatillos but I want the richness and the texture of one that's made with roasted tomatillos. So I have some roasted tomatillos here I have some garlic that was roasted alongside of it and I'm peeling the little papery skins now off of the garlic here that's so you can see how incredibly soft it is and it will have some nice browned edges that will add a lot of flavor to the salsa and once I get those peeled I'm going to just throw them into a blender jar now with the this is a roasted habanero with something gutsy like the the tongue tacos I like to have something that's pretty spicy the four tomatillos that were roasted and then we have four tomatillos here that I'm going to cut into quarters just to make them easier to to blend in with everything else so this will give us that beautiful fresh crunch and lively lively texture and taste and then we'll just blend it till it's a sort of I'm going to say coarse puree is what I'm going to call this and we'll scoop these guys in there it wouldn't be a salsa verde without some cilantro so I'm just going to tear off some cilantro and put that in there and then put the top on it and blend it now you can see it still has some texture in it when I pour it in here I'm looking for that for sure we have one other ingredient that's going to go in here it's a little bit of onion this is a pretty large onion and we just need a half of a small one so about a quarter of that will do it so I'll go ahead and slice this one way and then I'm going to cut it this way to make small dice now because this is going to go into the salsa raw I am going to rinse it off which you've seen me do many times because that takes away that strong onion flavor that certainly doesn't agree with everybody and I think can overwhelm the salsa really fast so I've got a strainer here and I'm just going to scoop this onion into the strainer and we're going to take it over to the sink and rinse it off under cold water I recommend this with any preparation that's going to have raw onion in it you have created a sulfurous compound just by cutting up the onion bringing two elements together you made it you can get rid of it so I'm going to put that on top there of course I need to season it with salt my experience tells me that a scant teaspoon is the right amount for this so I'll put that in there and then we'll just stir it up and it should be ready let's check the texture when we're doing this it looks like the perfect texture to me it doesn't need any water added to it I'm going to give that a taste and see if it's seasoned right man that looks so good I love this sort of variation of half raw and half roasted beautiful especially with that spicy habanero in there it's really great so our pan is warm here no it's not warm it's really hot right now I'm going to do this all over about a medium high heat you can brown in oil I'm using a little fresh rendered pork lard here and you want to get a nice even coating over the whole bottom of this pan about like that so it's not just a very thin film it's a little more than a thin film and now that that will heat up really fast I'm going to lay the tongue in there spreading it out into an even layer I don't want it stacked up that's why I'm using this really big pan if you have a smaller pan than this you'll probably want to do this in two batches and we're going to leave it undisturbed for two or three minutes until it gets really crispy on one side then we'll gently turn everything over and brown it on the other side I can see that there is a lot of beautiful browning going on here heating the pan ahead and then getting that ah look at that you can't imagine how delicious this smells right now if you like short rib this is a sort of short rib like smell and taste turn over those last few pieces there boy this is great we're going to let it go for another couple of minutes and brown the other side and then we're ready to make tacos now if the richness of this meat isn't enough you might want to put a slice of avocado on each one of them one of the ways that you can do that is what I'm showing you right here except that one's not starting well and that is to just cut down to the pit and make little slices like that that come out with the skin on them I'm going to turn this off now because it's ready to go I've got warm tortillas here um I will put a couple of them down here these are steamy hot and we will top them with some of the tongue meat I'm just going to take it straight out of the skillet and lay that there now if that doesn't look enticing I think I haven't done my job okay because this is like one of my favorite things and I think you've already picked that part of it up so we've got the crispy tongue now um on here I would put the salsa on next just a spoonful of it across each one and then I'm going to take the the avocado and just peel that skin right off of it like that lay that over the top and then we've got tongue tacos for the ages I think you're going to love these"}, {"title": "Cochinita Pibil Tacos -

Hi everyone and welcome back to my kitchen. This page in our taco manual is one of my absolute favorites. Super exciting to be making cochinita pibil with you today. And we are going to make the easiest version of it that I know. We're going to utilize a slow cooker, which means that it is easily within everybody's reach. And you know what? It actually makes one of the very best versions of this. So we're starting with a six quart slow cooker here. And I'm going to line it first with banana leaves. So some people may go, where would I ever find banana leaves? Well, the cool thing is that they're available pretty readily, both online and in major grocery stores these days. But if you live anywhere near a Mexican grocery store, they will likely have them too. I cut the top of this off so that I could slide this package of banana leaves out. Some of you will live in places where fresh banana leaves are available. So you're sort of on your own with those. They're packaged differently. But this piece, I am just opening up like this and you'll see some of the end pieces of the, or the ends of the large banana leaves here. The wonderful thing about banana leaves is that they are really, really enormous. So as you begin to open the package up, you will see just how big these things can be here. Now I don't need any more than just two pieces that are equally about two feet long. So I'm just going to use a knife to cut in here and cut one piece like that. Okay. Some people will tell you to cut the stiff part off here. For this preparation, we really don't need to do that. If we were making tamales, I would say absolutely we have to do that. And then I need another piece that is equal in size to that one. So I'll keep unfolding here, take that piece off and cut down through here. And with this piece, I will put it down in there. I'm not very happy with how long that one is. So nice thing is that I can just cut off another piece of it here. I didn't even have to cut that piece off and lay that in here. We're going to want to completely envelop a piece of pork shoulder roast with the bone in. And so we've now lined our slow cooker with the banana leaves. So I'm going to set those aside, probably wondering what you could do with it. Well, of course you could make the tamales and that's another whole process and everything, but you could also just slide them back into the freezer and keep them for your next batch of cochinita pibil. Now we have to make the classic achiote marinade, and I'm going to suggest that you use the achiote. This is one of my favorite brands, El Yucateco, that you're going to use the pre-made paste. In spite of the fact that I've put out there a lot of recipes for how to make this paste, it's pretty labor intensive and it takes more than one day to really get it good. This stuff you can just open up and I'm going to take about half of this. I'm going to break it here, still using the cellophane that wraps it. I'm going to break it in half and let half of it fall down in here into the blender jar. You can do this without a blender. I just find it pretty annoying because this stuff is so thick and we are going to want to dilute it or soften it with some lime juice. I'm going to put two teaspoons of salt in here. I'm going to do heaping ones. I'm working with the crystal diamond salt, which is not as powerful as table salt, but you need about two teaspoons of table salt in this. Then put the top on and blend it until it's very smooth. For such a beloved recipe, this is actually quite easy to make, especially since we're starting with the achiote paste already there. I've got our three pounds here of the pork shoulder roast. Set that down in there. I've got a large onion that I'm going to slice about one quarter of an inch thick. We will pour our marinade all over the meat. This stuff is very staining, so you want to make sure to keep it away from things that you don't want to have that beautiful rusty red look to it. We will sprinkle these onions over the top. Some people put some chili, some green chili on this, not like habanero, which we will serve with this, but like what they would call shikatik chilies in the Yucatan Peninsula. I've got a half a cup of water. It doesn't need very much at all for this braise to happen. Put that around there. Now fold the leaves down over the package that you have here. Put the top of it on like that, and I'm going to slide the slow cooker base in, put this on the top, and then we're going to turn it on for six hours on high. You're going to love me for this. Okay, I'll meet you back here in six hours. Okay, it has been six hours of sheer torture, sheer torture, okay, because the smell of this cooking in the house is so beautiful, but now it's time to unveil it. I'm going to actually take it off of here. Now remember, I'm just going to set it right there. I did that because I wanted to smell that and fog up my glasses here. Okay, so we've got this beautiful piece of, I think I'm going to use a pair of tongs to get it out here. But we've got all of this banana leaf on here, and we've got the meat down in here, and what I'm going to do to start off here is to take the meat out. Now first thing, I can just take this part out and set it to the side, and then take the meat itself out, sort of breaking it into large chunks as we put it into a serving dish. Okay, now over to the stove, and I'm going to put the flame here on high, use my tongs to to take out the banana leaf, getting as much of the juice as possible back in there. And got one straight piece of meat. Now if the meat that when you're making this isn't super tender and like fall off the bone tender, you're going to want to shred this a little bit more. But at this point I am going to bring this to a boil, cook it down till it's almost a glaze, we certainly don't want more than one cup of it, and then pour the hot reduced juices over that beautiful meat, and we're going to be ready to serve then. It just keeps getting better, the smell of this reducing liquid here, these cooking juices is so amazing. Just shake it around, I want some consistency to it because I don't want it to just be completely watery. Let's pour that over this meat here, that looks good. Wow, that's so gorgeous. So now we've got our habanero salsa, classic, classic, the one they call coot, that is made from roasted habaneros and roasted garlic and some citrus. Then we've got the pickled red onions, warm tortillas of course, and I am not going to waste another second. Take a little bit of the meat with some of the juice of course, because that tangy achiote cooking broth that's infused with the flavor of the habanero chilies. Now coot is meant to be put on just in little droplets because it's extremely hot, and then of course the beautiful pickled red onions, that looks like the right amount. And I will tell you, this stuff is worth its weight in gold."}, {"title": "How to Throw the Perfect TACO PARTY | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Iw9kE6JD95g/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCkSTrqu8lve-aoRhUaBoJggFI9kw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw9kE6JD95g&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=36&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "So maybe you've wondered how to put together a casual taco party. Well this page in our taco manual tells you how. I like casual parties. I love to invite people over. So maybe you're inviting over six or eight friends. What would you put together? Well, this is what I would put together. I've got my plates and my hot tortillas over here. I would put out three different taco fillings. I've got rajas con crema, one of my very favorite, the roasted poblanos that are cooked with caramelized onions and some reduced cream. This one's got a little greens in there because that's the way I like to make it. Then we've got chicken tinga over here. I love the smokiness and I love the classic garnishes of avocado and fresh cheese. Nothing is better or makes your house smell better than making cochinita pibil. You can do it early, early in the day and serve this beautiful thing at night. And of course it gets served with the pickled red onions and habanero salsa. But I've put out a couple of other salsas as well. I always think that the chipotle salsa made with roasted tomatillos is incredibly versatile and delicious. And the roasted tomatillo salsa with green chili and cilantro is great. I put a little bit of extra queso fresco out here because hey, who doesn't like a little of that over the top? It's really great with the rajas con crema. And then it wouldn't be a taco feast without some limes to sprinkle over the top. But that's not the whole thing. It can't just be the tacos. You need some accompaniments. So if it's a really casual party, then I would say that you should have some black beans or whatever color bean is your favorite. I like to serve them in a cast iron pan because it keeps them warm. And some Mexican red rice is super classic. But again, keep it warm in your rice cooker. This may be the whole thing or maybe you want to put out a big salad. And if you went to the Mexican grocery store to buy some of your ingredients, I highly recommend bringing home some of those incredibly interesting Mexican candies. Put a big bowl of those out for dessert or serve your friends some ice cream. This with some margaritas or micheladas, maybe a bottle of white and a bottle of red would fill out the taco party for you. It's not nothing, but it's casual and it's fun and everybody is going to have a blast."}, {"title": "Tacos Placeros, A Mexican Marketplace Treat | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L-0AJ-ZZD_0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLAONO2ByfUZ4Q7dxe8iUUo4WFVf8A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-0AJ-ZZD_0&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=37&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Tacos Placeros. Iconic Mexican flavors. Hi and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to one of the most traditionally flavored tacos you will ever find in Mexico and it might surprise you. You know I know a lot of people are into steak tacos or chicken tacos or maybe barbacoa tacos but this one sort of leans toward classic vegetable preparation in Mexico but before you click off from this I'm going to teach you how to work with nopal, the cactus paddles, the prickly pear cactus paddles and you're going to want to know this because these things are delicious, crunchy, really beautiful. So just imagine this taco. It's got this nopal salad on it. It's got some fresh cheese, a panela cheese that goes on there, crumbled up chicharron over that. It's called a taco placero because it is just a marketplace taco. It's the kind of thing that you find all through central Mexico. Let's start with the nopales part of this. So you buy them either cleaned or uncleaned in your Mexican grocery store. Maybe you go to a regular grocery store that has them. I've seen them in big chain grocery stores occasionally but if you get the ones that are uncleaned, get the cleaned ones if you can, but if you get the ones that are unclean this is a way that you clean them. Always work with a pair of tongs. Cut around the exterior of the nopal paddle and you're going to cut off all the spines that are right there on the edge of it and once you get back to the top here which is where the nopal paddle connected to the plant, cut the end of that off and then holding your knife perpendicular to the work surface to the nopal paddle just work across it scraping off all of those nodes. Now you want to be you want to do this very carefully so that you do get all of the nodes off and the truth of the matter is it's easy to see them because they're dark. They're a dark brown color and so when you see them go off you know that you have scraped off all of the spines. Flip it over and we're going to do the same thing on the other side. This recipe that I'm giving you today starts with four medium-sized paddles that'll give you about a pound and in lots of the Mexican grocery stores the clientele didn't want to do this at home so they actually sell them already cleaned completely so if you want to avoid this part of it go to your Mexican grocery store to get them. Next step here is to cut them into smaller pieces and I'm just going to split it lengthwise like that and then go crosswise about a half a little less than a half an inch here. I'm going to cut through all of these. Now all of this is going to go into a saucepan. This one holds about two quarts and that'll be the right amount to do this and once we get it all into the pot I'm going to set it here over a medium heat and then put the top on it. Okay we're going to cover that oh one second though I have to salt these before we continue because the salt is actually going to draw out the substance that we have to talk about next. Okay working with nopal cactus. Okay a little bit like working with okra it's going to exude shall we call it a mucilaginous substance. It's going to get really sticky that thing that they call baba or drool in Spanish and we we don't want that so the first thing that we're going to do we're cooking these in the way they would call al vapor in Mexico. We're going to let it cook covered here for about five minutes and that salt is going to help to draw out all of that mucilaginous substance and then we are going to uncover it and we're going to cook it until it's dry and then you'll have this beautiful crunchy lemony flavored nopal cactus but we gotta let it cook. Okay let's take a look at this it's been about five minutes now and you can see that there is a bunch of that sticky substance here on the bottom and as you as I pick these tongs up I should be able to sort of that's the drooly stuff so we'll keep stirring it now and let it cook for another five minutes or so until it's completely dry. Okay it's been about five minutes now my mixture looks completely dry I'll just bring it over here so that you can see how dry it looks now on the bottom. Okay I stirred it really regularly through that whole time because I wanted as much evaporation as I possibly get. I'm going to let that cool down to room temperature while I cut up all of the ingredients that go into this sort of cactus salad shall we call it uh for this taco and they will not surprise you it is going to be a tomato it's some onion some green chili I've got some cilantro over here the classic things that go into pico de gallo which actually makes this taste so incredibly Mexican. So on to the chopping. So the ingredients here. I've got the cooled down nopales over here. So I'm going to just put those into the mixture. Now I've got to season it. Two things I'll season it with. One will be a little bit of salt and then I'm going to squeeze some lime over it. That's really essential in this kind of a salad. Using a Mexican lime juicer here to squeeze about a half a lime over the top of it. And just the smell of that takes me right to Mexico for sure. Now I'm going to mix all of this together. I put two serranos in here because I wanted it to be spicy. If you don't want it to be very spicy then you could go with one. But just look at it. Talk about taking you straight to Mexico. That does it. Now we've got queso panela. So this is another of the Mexican fresh cheeses. It's kind of a spongy white cheese. You could use queso fresco here. I cut it into small pieces. Some limes because you, as I said before, want to serve these tacos with lime for each guest to squeeze over the top. Some avocado and then this beautiful light chicharron. This is what we're looking for. Something that can crumble really easily because we're going to crumble this over the top of the taco. Okay I've got these warm corn tortillas here that I'm going to put onto a plate. And then I'm going to build the taco placero. So we'll start with our our nopal cactus salad or salsa here. Put that right down the center here and then on will go some of our queso panela. Just a nice little bit of it on each one of these. Now I'm going to put one of these slices of avocado. Boy that looks good and that's going to add that gorgeous creamy element. Of course we have to serve it with lime wedges and then this is the crowning glory of it. That's the crumbled chicharron. Now you can do this in tiny pieces like I'm crumbling it up over here which I like because that gives me more of the flavor of the chicharron in every bite. Or you can just do it in bigger chunks like that. But ah gorgeous. Okay these are the iconic flavors of Mexico's tacos placeros."}, {"title": "6 Ingredient, Foolproof Flan | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RVx-ZhTYRus/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLA-8OtKS8crEr9LY26SVC_ouPHKEg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVx-ZhTYRus&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=38&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Foolproof flan for non-bakers. Hello everybody and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is going to take us to a place that's kind of unexpected. Now if you're going to have people over for a taco party, you probably want to do a little dessert at the end. So today it is dessert for a taco party. It's my foolproof flan recipe and even if you're not a baker, I'm going to show you how to make flan in a way that is super approachable and you're going to look like a star. People are going to say, wow, you baked this? And you can say yes. Okay. So first of all, we're going to make them individual. So we've got to have something to bake them in. Probably a lot of you have muffin tins that are like this. You can use this, but it's way easier if you have the flexible ones, the silicone ones like this. And in fact, if this is all you have, well, your wishlist probably should include these because even if you like to make some muffins every once in a while, this is a better way to bake them. So we're going to bake these flans in there. You can see I've put this in a large pan here. If you don't have a big roasting pan of some sort that these will fit into, you're going to have to divide them up and two casserole dishes will work just fine. The whole idea is that we're going to pour water around them to protect them while they're baking so they don't get over baked. That's one of the things that makes this a fool proof recipe. OK, so we've got that all set up there. We got to do the caramel part of this first. Now, most flan recipes will have you caramelize sugar. People are afraid of caramelizing sugar. Number one, it's super hot. And if it gets on you, it will really burn you. But also people are afraid of burning the caramel or not getting it dark enough, whatever. This recipe, we're going to use store bought cajeta. Always look for the stuff that is made from goat milk because it's got the richest flavor. And it comes in a couple of different colors. There's light ones that are really readily available, and then there are the darker ones like this. Usually it says quemado on the front of it. And that's the one that I like, but you can make it with either one. Now, I poured out about a half a cup of this and I put it into the microwave to get it really fluid. And I am going to pour, we're going to make eight of these, but I'm going to prepare for nine because sometimes, depending on the size of the eggs, you will be able to have enough of the custard mixture to actually do nine of them. Okay, now we've got that there. You want to tilt them around just to make sure that the bottom is completely covered here. You don't have to worry too much. If you get most of it covered, it'll still work out just fine for you. Okay, so we've got that there. We want to lay them as flat as possible here. Now, on to the making of the custard. So this is a sort of foolproof recipe only because I have calculated the ingredients so that they will cook very evenly and they will cook, giving you a little bit of leeway as to when they're done. And so we're going to start off here with three eggs in a bowl. And then we're going to do four egg yolks that are going to go in here. So I'll show you how I do the separating of the eggs. I do it directly into my hand because that is the easiest way for me to control it. Your hand is very soft and it will allow the white to go straight through. I am doing the whites into a deli container here because I'm going to save them for something else. And I can just put them into the refrigerator where they will last for several days before I finish using them. Okay, that goes to the side there. Those whites go to the side there. And I'm going to beat them until I no longer see the differentiation between white and yolk. All one color. Next thing that's going to go in is the ace in the hole, sweetened condensed milk. Not only does it have a distinctive flavor, but it also is made in such a way that it will help to protect this custard when it's cooking. So dump that in. I already took the top off because if you've ever worked with sweetened condensed milk, you know that it's sticky stuff. And sometimes that taking the top off can get your hands all sticky. So we've got that there. And then I'm going to put in about two teaspoons of vanilla extract because I want this to be very distinctively vanilla flavored. If you want to throw in a little extra, that will always be welcome. Now this takes a second because sweetened condensed milk is very dense. So you have to mix it in until everything is completely smooth. Okay, before we started, I put a cup and a half of milk over a low fire over here to get hot. Now I'll show you that when I whisk things, hot mixtures into something in a bowl, especially, I almost always will put down a damp towel because it keeps the bowl from moving. And I am going to slowly put this in. This is going to heat up the custard mixture, meaning that it will cook more quickly in the oven and more uniformly. So I'm just kind of dribbling this in, heating up the egg and sweetened condensed milk mixture. Okay, that's going to go over there. This will be easiest to do from some vessel that has a spout on it. So I've got a quart measuring cup here. And we will pour into the cajeta lined molds all the way up to the top. Okay, the next step is to bake these and we're going to make this a little water bath. I put on a tea kettle and I've got steaming hot water. It should be just below a boil basically, but I'm going to ask you to come around and we're going to put this water in here when we get the oven door open. Okay, I've got the oven preheated to 325 degrees, so it's not real hot. I've got my water over here. This is the way that I like to work with putting the water in to create this hot water bath. Let's slide this here. I am baking in the middle of the oven here. And I've got a little space down here where I can pour the hot water. And we want to get to about an inch of depth. I always start with a couple of quarts of water just so that I have plenty here. And when that gets to that depth of about an inch, which I'm at right now, then I will carefully move this into the oven, not splashing anything. Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully, yes, got that in. These are going to bake for about, I'm going to say 35 to 40 minutes, something like that. You want to check them. And when they get to the right stage of doneness, I'm going to show you what it looks like. Okay, let's check these out. I can sort of tell just by jiggling this that they're almost completely set. What we're looking for is that it looks like almost set jello, but not quite firmly set. So use your finger and just touch them and see where they are. A little jiggle in the middle is the right thing. And then we're just going to take them out, let them cool off in this water bath. And then we'll refrigerate them for a couple of hours to firmly set them. These are really chilled and firm now. When you touch them, they should sort of bounce back like jello would. And the next step that we have to take is to release them from the side. So I'm just using a small knife to go around all of them. You do that carefully so as not to cut off little chunks of the flan. Okay, you probably noticed that I kept the blade of my knife tilted toward the exterior of the little molds there. Next thing to do is to just see if you can kind of loosen them up a little bit more. Now I've got this on a half sheet pan. I'm going to put another one on top of it. This is the way that I have found that this is easiest to do. And so I'm going to just sort of move these like that, up and down a little bit, flip them. Okay. And here's where you'll see the utility of working with one of these, or two of these little flexible muffin tins, because we can kind of go around here and press in. You can't do that with one of the aluminum muffin tins. But you can shake it back and forth and make sure that everything is sort of out of there. You can usually tell whether or not they have released because they'll kind of come up really quickly and easily. I can feel that I think all of those have released. Yeah, I think so. Let's take a look at this one. So I peel this off. Beautiful. Almost beautiful. We've got these last, oh, those didn't have anything in them. So let's peel these guys off here. Same kind of thing. Make sure that they're released. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. That last little one there. Now at this point, it's really best to go back and scrape out any of the cajeta that is stuck in here. That'll just give you a little bit more of that to spoon over when you serve these guys. And of course, you can do all of this work before your guests arrive in and keep these in the refrigerator is really the best. They're easier to serve when they are cool. And I usually will just grab a small spatula and scoop one of these guys up like that. One of my favorite things in the world, a beautiful flan."}, {"title": "Fresh Tamarind and Apple Cider Snakebite | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hVSCYIcBCbw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBYnCOmB83g10YisCg1cZJO2aRoDg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVSCYIcBCbw&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=39&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Tamarind snakebite. Perfect for day drinking. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a Welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual, well, it's a beverage because you need beverages, right, when you're serving tacos. And one of my favorite things to serve is a Mexican version of a snakebite. Probably you know what a snakebite is. It's that half beer and half cider. And if you can use really great cider, fresh pressed cider, it's even better. But we're going to take a twist on that and we're going to add tamarind pulp to it. So I'm going to show you how to make tamarind pulp. Well, you can make your own tamarind pulp, which is going to give you something incredibly fresh, or you could just go to your Mexican grocery store and go to the freezer section and you can find a whole lot of these Goya frozen products and they make a tamarind pulp, which I think is quite passable. Easy, a little more involved, but this is going to teach you something about tamarind, which is one of my favorite flavors. Okay, this is a tamarind pod and these are the kind that you want to purchase, ones that look pretty much intact. Then I usually crack them like that and then take the stem end here and sort of wiggle that around and start pulling out all of these little feathery parts that are like that. If you want to get rid of that, then make sure that all the rest of the shell is off. I'm going to put those to the side and then continue on until I have gotten them all peeled and all of these little feathery parts off of them. Okay, we're about finished wrestling these tamarind pods free from all of their shells and from all of the little stringy bits that run down them like that. Okay, as most of the strings are off, if you see a few, it's going to be just fine. I've got two cups of water that I have had over a low fire here. It's steaming now. I'm going to bring it up just a little bit to come to a boil and then take the tamarind pods and put them down in here. There should be plenty of water to cover them. And now I'm going to turn that off, let that sit for an hour to two hours. It'll come to room temperature and those tamarind pods will soften up really beautifully. Then I'll show you how we get the pulp away from the seeds. Okay, look at this. So the pulp is easily sort of mushed away. There's one of those strings that I didn't get. It's mushed away from the seeds there. And I'm going to show you how I do it. I literally just put one of my hands in here and start running the pods between my fingers as I make a fist and that will dislodge all of that pulp. It's starting to look a little bit like what you get in the frozen food section. Okay, I've got my hand in here, mushing around the tamarind pods. I'm going to strain it now. So just a medium mesh, nothing fancy for this at all. If you've got a really fine strainer, this is not the place to use it. Okay, that all goes in there and then I'm going to just use my hand too. That's why I haven't washed my hand yet, to get all of the pulp out. To get all of this stuff pressed through. And that gives me an opportunity also at this time to work some more of the pulp away from the seeds. Okay, we've got almost all of that pulp pressed through here. This is one of my beliefs about cooking, that you will never find anything as efficient as your hand to do certain tasks with. So yeah, you could be doing this with the back of a spoon, but I'll tell you it would take you three or four times longer. Now look at what we've got here. You can see it's mostly just seeds and there's a little bit of pulp still left on it, but not enough to mess with here. I'm going to go wash my hands, get rid of this pulp, and then we are going to measure what we've got here. Let's see what our quantity is here. Some of it's a little bit thicker than other parts of it, so I wanted to mix it before I pour it in here. I'm looking for two cups, and if I don't have quite two cups, I will add some water to get to that point. So just a little splash of water will give me what I want here. And that, folks, is tamarind pulp. Now on to making the Mexican snake bite. Tamarind pulp. Homemade tamarind pulp is super fresh tasting. Okay, this by the way is not tamarind concentrate. The equivalent in the frozen food counter is that Goya product. Now we've got this unpasteurized beautiful cider. I'm going to put about half of it in there. And blend this mixture to combine. Now it gets beautifully foamy. I'm going to put in the last little bit of this cider. Give it a couple of pulses here. And my encouragement to you is that you do this part of it long before your guests arrive and put this into the refrigerator and get it really, really cold. Okay, so this foamy mixture now, I'm going to, I don't know if I can measure exactly because it's so foamy here, but let's say that I want about two-thirds of a cup of it that are going to go into each of the glasses. I'm going to make a couple of these guys. Just look at that. So refreshing looking. So we'll divide that up here between the two glasses. And then I've got a beer. Modelo Negro is a really good choice for this because it marries so beautifully with the tamarind flavor and also with the flavor of the apple cider. Now this is going to impress your guests. I can tell you that because not only does it look super cool, but it also has a really rich and beautiful flavor. Undeniably Mexican because of that tamarind that's in there.

The next page in our taco manual takes us to something called Tacos de Alhambra. Now, before you Spanish speakers go, what, he's going to be making tacos of wires? I will tell you where that alhambra fits in here. Yes, it is the word for wires, but in northern Mexico, especially, they love to eat these sort of shish kebab-like things they call alhambras. And what they put on there, the vegetables, the tocino, the bacon, the beef, is all going to come off, get chopped up. I'm going to cook it like a taco a la plancha. Well, but I'm going to be using a big cast iron skillet here. And then we're going to cover it in melted cheese, kind of a modern thing, but who doesn't like some seared steak with melted cheese? So the first step in this, I've got four slices, thick slices of bacon here that I've just cut crosswise like that. I've preheated this pan. It's about over a medium high heat here, and I'm going to put the bacon in there. You can hear it start to sizzle right away. Okay, so we will stir this around pretty regularly until it's completely crisp. I actually like to cook bacon over that higher temperature rather than lower because I can get it done and out of the pan when it's just at the perfect stage. Okay, so next step is to cut up a piece of steak. Now you've got lots of choices here. My choice would be ribeye, but you could use a New York strip steak. You could use a sirloin steak if you like that, that leaner texture of it. But this piece of ribeye, I'm going to cut it into about half inch pieces and then cut it crosswise so we have nice little cubes. And then I'm going to season it with salt and pepper. As with all beef preparations, the seasoning with salt should be liberal. And then I've got a good amount of black pepper, freshly ground over the top. When you fresh grind the pepper, it has so much more flavor. Now, time to check this bacon. It's rendering nicely. I want it to render enough so that I can sear that beef in it. If the rendering is not sufficient for a good sear on the beef, then I'll add a little bit more bacon drippings or I could use freshly rendered pork fat, pork lard, or even vegetable oil if I wanted to. Beautifully crispy bacon here. I'm going to take it out with a slotted spoon so that I can make sure that we leave as much of the fat behind as possible, but it rendered a good amount. I didn't think that it was going to. Okay, so we've just got the fat in the pan now, and I'm going to start searing this beef. Now, it has to go in an uncrowded layer. Otherwise, it won't brown. It'll just kind of stew around there. So I'm going to just knock it all off into the pan and then very quickly spread it out. Make sure that it's nicely coated with the fat that is in this pan. And then I'm going to let it cook undisturbed on one side. Remember to spread out all the pieces, but I'm going to let it cook on one side undisturbed so that it gets some really good browning. If I basically stir fry it, keep it moving all the time, the meat will get overdone before it gets brown. Okay, you've got to have patience, otherwise it won't brown. But now I've turned a couple of these pieces over and seen that they are richly browned underneath. So now I'm going to stir it around like that. I'm not meticulous on this part, but I will let it sit for another minute or so to brown whatever's touching down here. If you want to be meticulous, you could turn every piece over, but I'm just going to let this sit for a minute or so so that we get a little browning on that other side. And then we're going to do the final seasoning. Now, this is one of the things that I use kind of like a secret weapon because it boosts umami. They do the same thing a lot in Mexico with jugo maggi, and just sprinkle some of that over the top. I put about a tablespoon or so in there. Stir until it's all reduced, and that will coat this meat with an absolutely delicious, delicious flavor. Now, I'm going to scoop all of this into a bowl, and we will turn the heat off for a minute while we prep all the vegetables. Now, the vegetables that we have for this, I'm using poblano peppers. To tell you the truth, in Mexico, a lot of people use green bell peppers, red bell peppers. They love that sweetness in a dish like this. I like the more robust flavor of the poblano, and I'm going to clean it by just pulling out the seed pod and stem, and then we will cut this into strips. Now, for this, there's lots of ways that you can do it. A lot of people, I'm going to get these stray seeds out of my way here. A lot of people will flatten the poblano like that and then cut crosswise, and I find that to be the easiest way to do this. Okay, I'm going to move those guys back there, and then we have a big chunk of onion here. I will cut the root end off there and slice that. Now, next step will be to heat the pan up again. Make sure it has enough fat to coat the bottom for this sauteing. Now, my pan doesn't have quite enough fat to coat the bottom of it here, so I'm going to put a little bit of fresh-rendered pork lard here. I always emphasize fresh-rendered because you don't want to buy those bricks of that stuff in the grocery store. It's hydrogenated, it's old, it doesn't really have the kind of thing that we're looking for flavor-wise here. Plus, when it's hydrogenated, I can tell you it's not good for you. Fresh-rendered pork lard is better for you than butter is, but not the stuff that you find in the bricks in the grocery store. Okay, I'm going to saute these now until they begin to soften some, and I'm going to scrape up everything that's at the bottom of the pan. That stuff is so delicious, and it will flavor these onions and poblanos incredibly well. When the onions begin to brown and have softened some but still have a bit of crunch to them, we'll be ready to finish this dish. Oh, just look at these beauties here. They're still kind of crunchy, which is what I'm always looking for, but they're so beautifully coated with all the meat juices that caramelized on the bottom of the pan here. We'll put our meat back in there. Stir that, and we have to let it re-warm for just a minute here. These are definitely like Friday night tacos. It's not something you just throw together for a quick meal, but something when you want to do something kind of special for family or friends. Now, the next thing that I'm going to do is to sprinkle on some melting cheese. Mexican melting cheese could be anything from, they call it manchego. It's not really related to Spanish manchego at all, but you'll see a lot of that in the Mexican grocery stores, or one that's called chihuahua cheese, but don't hesitate to just use something that is like your Monterey Jack or Colby or a mild cheddar for this. Any of those will work. And we're just going to let this sit until that cheese starts to melt here. Okay, now it's started to melt. I'm going to give it a gentle stir here. Turn off the heat. And we've got a nice cheesy mass here. Not a mess, but a mass. And I will lay down a towel here and transfer the pan over to here. It's sizzling and looking really delicious. The crispy bacon goes over the top here, just evenly spread it on. I've got some cilantro here, and I will just take a bunch of the cilantro leaves to sprinkle over the top. I will tell you, this is really wonderful to serve straight in the pan that you have made it in because then everybody can go in with a warm tortilla in their hands and scoop up some of this kind of cheesy goodness. Now, because this is a rich taco, I really like to use Mexican hot sauce on top of it. So I put some of that, it's tangy, it's spicy. It'll cut through all the richness and then you just enjoy."}, {"title": "The Perfect Late-Night Snack: Quesadillas de Gloria | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kt8qn4r2MW0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCMXRqm5x6JtpsDWY_VRopncn2CSQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt8qn4r2MW0&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=41&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "A little something sweet and savory to serve at the end of your taco party. These are quesadillas de gloria. Now if you're gonna serve tacos to your friends and family, don't you want to end with something sweet? I know I do. Well I was at this event at the Culinary Institute of America one time and I met this chef named Ceci Gonzalez from Monterrey and she made what I'm gonna make for you. I call them quesadilla de gloria because it is a combination of savory and sweet. I know that will appeal to a lot of you because it has savory cheese and then these little gloria candies. Now if you haven't tasted gloria candies, they're available in all of the Mexican grocery stores and they are unbelievably good. They are made from goat's milk, so a little cajeta-like caramel, and then they're studded with pecans which are native to northern Mexico. I love these things. So you buy them in little bags like this and then take them out of their, this is the Sevillana brand, there's a couple of brands out there, but the Sevillana brand is the one that you see the most often. So take them out of their red cellophane and you can see it looks like caramel with a lot of pecans in them and then I'm going to cut them up into little bits. Okay, very few ingredients here. I've got some flour tortillas, the chopped up gloria candy, some shredded cheese. You can use anything from cheddar cheese to jack cheese. This is a type of artisan jack that we use in our restaurant. I've got a little bit of butter here that I'm going to put on this preheated griddle. I have it sort of a medium heat and I'm going to put down some of this butter too because it makes these taste so good. Okay, so I'm going to kind of spread that butter around here. You don't need too much of it but you'll see at the end how beautiful it makes these. Then I'm going to put three five inch flour tortillas down here and on top of that I will spread the cheese. It's about an ounce of cheese so it's not too much on any one of them. So you'll spread it out and it's going to be an equal amount of the gloria candy. So you can see how I'm saying that they're like savory and sweet at the same time. But boy, I love these things and everybody that tastes them really loves them as well. Okay, so that is the right amount of cheese down. Now we'll divide the gloria candies over the top. It's been about a couple of minutes now. I always peek underneath to see if they're getting some browning going on there but I'm looking to see that the cheese is melted here and now I'm just going to fold them over like that. So you've got your little kind of quesadilla shape here and the last one here. Yeah, you don't want to leave them on so long that they get crispy and start cracking and we're going to leave them for a couple minutes longer for that caramel to soften and mix with the cheese. I'll turn them a couple of times as they are browning. Okay, we're going to take these off. I hear a little sizzling cheese on the side, some that has come out one of the sides there and then the sides there and then I'm going to cut them in half. So I make these little triangles because that is such a nice thing to be able to serve to people and so I'm going to put them on here like this so that they have a pretty little look. I like to sprinkle them with just a little bit of sugar over the top. It will stick to the buttery exterior of this and there you have it. Your little quesadilla, the gloria I call them after the candy that is here, savory and sweet and so incredibly satisfying."}, {"title": "Easy Plancha- or Grill-Roasted Knob Onions | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xZ99TWtPBKk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLCoXj8RLBGemK63XVGmNnoOWeJtcQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ99TWtPBKk&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=42&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Sweet, caramely knob onions, your taco's best friend. Hi everyone and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual is going to take us to one of the most classic accompaniments that you find in taquerias. Now you would usually find this in ones that feature either tacos a la plancha, the griddle seared ones, or tacos al carb\u00f3n, the ones that are done over the charcoal or some sort of gas grill. And it is cebollitas. These are knob onions. Now if you haven't seen these in your grocery store, you're not alone. Because regular grocery stores often don't carry the cebollitas or the knob onions. The ones that are basically a white onion that is harvested right away when the knob part of it, or the little green onion, is about one inch in diameter. I like the ones that are one inch in diameter, but some people will actually cook the ones that are slightly bigger than that. But let's just say we're going to start out with one inch diameter ones here. Now there's a lot of green here, and my preference, because the green part can kind of get unwieldy in this, is to cut a chunk of it off at the top here, leaving, oh let's just say, about eight inches of the top there. The next step with this, and I'm going to show you the plancha version or the griddle version, but it's exactly the same if you're going to do this on a grill, is to coat them with oil. And make sure that you coat both sides of them. And then I like to season them at this point. Some people will season them after they come off the griddle or grill, but I like to season them now. And then I'm going to put them directly on my griddle, which has already been preheated here. Now you can throw them down like this, but that's not my recommendation. My recommendation is to turn them to the side like this, and let the green parts hang over. I put a piece of foil there just to protect them. And then we're going to turn them. This is going to take around 15 minutes or so, because you have to cook these onions pretty slowly. And you'll start to see them softening, and as you turn them, they will be browned in splotches here. What you're doing is creating that unique flavor. There is nothing else like it anywhere. Of these griddled or grilled knob onions, bright flavor of white onion, but sweet and just so delicious. Okay, these are starting to look really, really good. Now I'm going to bring them down here. You can see that the tops are still vibrant green. You might like them that way. I kind of like them that way. But you could just turn them now if you wanted to on the griddle or in the pan. If you've got a 12-inch cast iron pan, that works really good for doing these kinds of onions. But I will tell you that once you develop a liking for these, you'll find yourself making them all the time, because as I said, they are unlike any other flavor, and it's just an absolutely delicious one. So then when you serve these, you can pick them up like this, bring them to a plate to serve them on. Now this would just be an accompaniment to go with your tacos. There are some people that like to cut them up, the whole thing, cut them up and serve them as a garnish for the tacos. Personally, I like to have them on the side. Remember we have already seasoned them with salt. So now I'm going to sprinkle them with fresh squeezed lime juice over the top. And there you have it, Cebollitas Asadas."}, {"title": "Tacos de Bistec Pt. 1: Campechano Tacos | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZ2rEG6wQ2I/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDCwmprGfn8vOvSxUf800OdRBsgFA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ2rEG6wQ2I&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=43&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Seared Beef and Chorizo Tacos Campechanos with Crunchy Chicharr\u00f3n. Hi everybody and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to, well, let's say a two-parter on bistec. Now you might not know what bistec is, but it's thin sliced beef easily available in any Mexican grocery store. You can find something similar in the American grocery stores that it will be called sandwich steaks. Thin sliced beef that's about an eighth of an inch thick. Now in Mexico you would find this being served in the places that do tacos al carb\u00f3n, the grilled meat tacos, but it's really a specialty of those that do tacos a la plancha, the ones that are cooked on big hot griddles. So let's dive first into the meat itself. So I've gotten these packages at Mexican grocery stores here in Chicago and it's very interesting that they're coming from two different cuts. My favorite is the one that's called diezmillo, which means chuck eye. It's like a thin cut chuck eye steak. It's got the best flavor, but a whole lot of the bistec will be cut from the sirloin. So you'll sometimes see it packaged if your Mexican market does things in English and Spanish. It will say it comes from the the sirloin. But I like the marbling and the extra flavor you get from the chuck eye steak cut into these very thin thin slices. It might remind you of some stuff that you see in your Asian markets as well. Okay, so this first one that we're going to be tackling it's called a taco campechano. Now campechano is a word that usually means two or more proteins that are mixed together and this one is going to be bistec with chorizo and then I'm gonna crumble a little chicharr\u00f3n on top because yeah why not and some of the places that I love in Mexico City do that so I'm sharing that with you. And we're going to add a little bit of onion and some potato to this one making it a little bit more hash like and really to my taste. So the first thing that we have to do I have this diezmillo or chuck eye steak and you can see it's that one eighth of an inch thick slice and I'm going to put salt on it season it nicely with salt. This is not a pre-salted one it's not like the cecinas that look like this but are salted and cured some okay and now I'm going to put into the skillet enough fat you I'm using fresh rendered pork lard here but you can use oil if that is to your taste and I want a nice even coat a little more than just a very thin layer and now it's time to put the beef in the pan. The pan was hot before I put the fat in there and so it got melted in and really really let's get move that over there like that and ready for the beef almost instantaneously. It'll take us about a minute or a minute I'll say about a minute and a half to get a nice sear on one side then I'm going to flip it over and get that brown on the other side. Brown is essential here for developing flavor for these tacos campechanos. Okay let's flip this over and see I've got some really nice browning on that so this piece should be ready as well yeah that looks really good and in Mexico oftentimes they plunge us the griddles are really big and they have really hot spots in them and so all of the meat will go down to get seared really beautifully and then they'll move everything over onto a less hot spot for all of the final cooking to do. If you get a chance go to this one called Taqueria Chupacabras some of you will know what Chupacabras means and they make big piles of this kind of hash like filling. They say it has 127 spices in it. I'm going to challenge you to even think up what 127 spices might be. After this is done you take it out I'm going to leave it over here so that I can chop it up and lay in the last piece of the beef here to sear in the same fashion. Okay that's now flat and in the pan okay anyway they make really good tacos campichanos at Chupacabras. Okay now I'm going to start to chop this up here and I'm going to do it by cutting crosswise and then once I get about quarter inch pieces these are always done very chopped you'll notice a lot of the taqueros in Mexico will use big that looks pretty good that's what we're looking for there we use big um big cleavers and they'll go at the meat and chop it up really fast. Okay this is nicely seared while the pan is still hot here now if there wasn't enough fat in here this rendered quite a bit um I would put a little bit more fat in here either that lard or the oil and now I'm putting in chorizo sausage I need to kind of break it up so it starts rendering but we're going to cook it with some onion which I'm going to chop now so I'm going to cut this up like this. And then I'm going to scoop this onion into the pan with the cooking chorizo and then start stirring this all together coating the onion with the rendered fat here and we'll cook this until the chorizo starts to brown and the onions are softening. Okay I've cut up the last piece of our beef stick and we've got the chorizo and the onions just about done grating two sort of medium size four ounce gold potatoes you could use any kind of boiling potato for this like the red skin ones and that sort of thing but you want about eight ounces for this recipe here and there we have it and we are going to put all of this back into the pan now with the chorizo and onions that chorizo is browned a little bit and we're there we go just mix that in really good before you add in the cooked and chopped beef stick this is smelling really good right now and I a lot of people don't put the potato in there so if you're averse to the potatoes don't put them in there I just happen to like it a lot and now I'm going to put all of the chopped and cooked beef stick in here and we're going to let this cook until it all sort of comes together in a hash like consistency potatoes won't take very long to cook because they're grated that smells really good now we're just missing one thing here which is our spices so I'm going to grind those in a little mortar here I'm putting in some cumin seeds and black pepper this is a little it's not a molcajete it is actually made from marble bought it in a market in the far-flung Philippines and it's just the perfect size for me to keep on my countertop and fresh grind spices with okay and sprinkle those spices over the top I've got the Mexican oregano bought at the Mexican market it's always going to be in the whole leaf form so rub it between your palms to crush those leaves it's always going to have the best flavor because the leaves crushed just before using gives you or releases the the oils which gives you the best flavor there this is looking just so good okay this is going to take a couple more minutes before everything is cooked through and nicely browned so I'll meet you back here then okay here's your optional ingredient it's that crunchy chicharron if you're going to the Mexican market to buy the bistec then pick up some chicharron well if you like the crunch I like the crunch and sort of saltiness of it you can crumble it by hand or you can do what I'm doing and sort of chop it will give you that sort of crumbled that crumbled consistency so now it's time to make these tacos I'm going to take the the skillet and move it over here and actually like to serve this in the skillet because it keeps this warm but you obviously need to have a large skillet to be able to do this really well I'm going to taste it and make sure that it's seasoned properly it might need just a little bit of salt no it actually doesn't chorizo is seasoned I seasoned the the meat that went in there it's nicely browned now I'll take a couple of tortillas warm tortillas here and lay those onto the plate like that and then I'm going to put just a little of this mixture oh wow does that smell good this is for meat lovers I can tell you that I'll put that on there and then this is to me the salsa to go with it we haven't eaten another video but this is the raw tomatillo avocado salsa creamy rich spicy tangy all of the things that you need to go along with this taco here and now this little la\u00f1ap as they say down in the in Louisiana little crunchies over the top of all of that and it's calling to me I just have to say to you all buen provecho and dive right in"}, {"title": "My Favorite Way to Brighten Up Any Taco: Onions with Habanero Chile | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KjOydgeWbbU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLANdT6YIHmG8wps8ZUzi6cOL_8aow", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjOydgeWbbU&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=44&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "The perfect way to brighten any taco. Welcome back to my kitchen, everybody. Yes, I am wearing gloves for this next page in our taco manual, which is to make one of the most classic accompaniments. You couldn't call it really a salsa. It's more like a relish that you can find in almost all taquerias these days. It is sliced white onion with habanero, chili, lime, salt, little Mexican oregano. It is dynamite. Yeah, really dynamite, because it really is a very spicy thing, which is one of the reasons I'm wearing these gloves to start with. Okay, so we are working here with habanero chilies, one of the spiciest chilies known to man. And to work with them, I'm going to cut this open, and then I'm going to pull out the stem and seed pod, discard that part of it. Now, this small amount that we're going to be making today could take up to two habaneros, but if you put the two habaneros in it, just know you are making something for your penchant for really spicy food or your families and friends like for that same thing. Now, we're slicing these crosswise very, very, very thin, and that's going to distribute their flavor. Now, when we talk about chilies in Mexican cooking, in Mexico, they don't talk about the heat first. They talk about the flavor first. In the United States, we're always talking about, oh, that gave a kick. Well, it's supposed to give flavor first and foremost, and that's what people really love about habanero chilies, is that they have this great fruity flavor, tropical fruity flavor. I always smell things like guava. You could sort of imagine strawberries in their flavors, mango, perhaps. I just think they're absolutely the most delicious of the fresh chilies if you're looking for something that has a lot of aroma and a lot of really beautiful flavor. So, I'm going to throw those into the pan here, the bowl, I should say, and then I'm going to ditch these guys. I'm not really fond of it, but when you're working with really hot, hot chilies, then you probably should be wearing the gloves. Okay, now, I am going to cut off the root end of this onion, and I'm going to slice it very thin. I'm going to say, like, sixteenth of an inch thick is what I'm going for. This is a really good place to talk about hand position in slicing, because I'm slicing really thin. So, I've got claw grip on the left, of course, like that, and I'm working with my knife directly up against my knuckle there. And so, I'm going down and I'm just moving my hand back about a sixteenth of an inch each time, so that I can get what I'm looking for. Now, I'm going to do the last little bit of it, like this, because it's too toppley to try to finish it off that other way. And I'll never get that last little bit done, so I'm going to pitch that along with the root end. Toss it on your board, so that you can separate all of the pieces. I still see a little piece of some root end there, so we'll mix that over here. And then, our next thing is just to season this mixture. You cut a lime in half. I like to roll it first on the cutting board, so that I get a loosened up structure on the inside. And then, I'm going to slice through this guy, turn it upside down into the Mexican lime juicer, and I'm looking for about a quarter of a cup, which is what this should yield here. And boy, when you get that skin crushed by the Mexican lime juicer, you can smell all of that incredibly beautiful aroma that you get in the oils that are in the skin of the lime. Now, we've got to season it with some salt, so I'm going to go salt first, and then I'm going to take a little bit of Mexican oregano. This is one that I bought at the Mexican market, so it comes in whole leaf form. And I'm going to crush it between my palms, as is very classic in the Mexican kitchen, and let the crushed leaves, which have a lot more aroma now that I've crushed them, down in there. It's a little stick I'm going to take out, stick from the... And then, I'm just going to grab a spoon and stir it up. Now, this is a mixture that will taste a little better in an hour or two, so feel free to just let it sit at room temperature, but it really is best if you will eat it or use it on your tacos the same day that it's made. The next day is okay if you refrigerate it overnight, but I really think the flavor and texture are best when you use this the same day that it's made. It's just so bright, so beautiful. I got the right amount of salt in there. I'm starting to taste the habaneros already, but onions with habanero, absolutely classic to go with tacos."}, {"title": "Tacos de Bistec pt. 2: Bistec Encebollado | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/seA5v6dqBe8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDu-1Qec5_rrAIPn_Kx4QMxUUgWcQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seA5v6dqBe8&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=45&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Seared steak and caramelized onions. What could be a better taco filling? Welcome back to my kitchen everyone! This page in our taco manual is part 2 of an exploration on Tacos de Bistec. Now if you want more information about what that Beef cut is, the Bistec is, then you could go to the video that I did on Tacos Campechanos and I go very deeply into it there. But for this one, we're going to be doing Bistec en Cebollado. That means with caramelized onions. So we're gonna sear the beef and we're gonna mix it up with these caramelized onions And that is actually where I am going to start. I'm gonna slice up a very large onion here I'm gonna cut the root end off of both sides of it and I want to cut this into strips Slices that are about a little less than a quarter of an inch each Okay, now we're gonna cook this in a pan and you find this kind of a taco a lot from street vendors that have these enormous planchas or griddles I'm gonna be working in a large cast-iron pan because I can get the most control of the heat with that and what we're Going to do first for the fat for this is to render the fat of bacon So I'm cutting a couple of thick slices of bacon. You need a couple of ounces of bacon You need to cut that into small strips and I've got the pan already hot here I'm gonna scoop this up and throw it into the pan and then I am going to stir this around For I'm gonna say three or four minutes as it starts to do its rendering before I add the onions to the pan Okay, my bacon doesn't have any fat in it not hardly anything rendered So if yours is like that, you're gonna want to add enough fat. It could be vegetable oil It could be bacon drippings that you've collected in your refrigerator. I'm going to be using a little bit of Fresh rendered pork lard because I have a really good one right now But the idea here is that we could actually have enough fat To coat all of these onions when we add them to the pan. So scoop those guys in now And I'm gonna season with two things One is some salt here and I'm going to add about a half a Teaspoon or so of salt. Well, we can go back in and re-season with salt at the end But then I'm also going to add some sugar and I'm gonna measure this amount this helps to caramelize the onion so I'm gonna sprinkle in one teaspoon of sugar and now we're going to Cook these for just a couple of minutes until we start to see just a little bit of browning Remember, we're still over a medium-high heat here And then I'm gonna turn the fire down to medium-low and let them caramelize for another five minutes or so Okay, I'm starting to see a little bit of browning on the onions here and I've noticed that they have softened quite a bit so this is the moment at which I will turn down the heat to about a medium-low and We will just let these cook for another five minutes or so until they're a deep rich golden color Wow, those are cooking there. I'm going to prepare the beef So I have this beef steak here and bought it a Mexican market It's eighth of an inch thick sort of classic beef steak a thickness This is the Esmillo or what is called the chuck eye My favorite because it's got good marbling. It's got really really good beefy flavor Um, so I'm gonna sprinkle over the top of this Salt now you want to be pretty generous with the salt in this as you do when you're cooking any kind of beef and then I'm going to Put some fresh ground pepper over the top of it here And When those onions are ready I'll meet you back here Okay, these are really browned now that will bring sweetness and depth of flavor Now use a slotted spoon to get them out of the pan And you really don't want to have any little pieces left here because we're gonna take the temperature up again So we can sear the beef for these beef steak encebo yado I'm just gonna use this cloth to get a little bit of pieces out Okay. Now I don't have enough fat Drained back into the pan. So I want to coat this with a nice layer of fat Tip the pan so that it's evenly coated I'm turning the temperature back up to a medium-high And Once I'm sure that this is really beautifully hot Then I'm gonna start laying in these pieces of beef steak now a lot of times you will buy beef steak and it will be In really large pieces. These are small and very manageable making the whole process Really really easy. Let's hear the sizzle and see if it's hot enough. Yeah, I think we got it Little sprinkling of salt on this side And we want to get these really brown which will take about a minute and a half or so Right, we got some beautiful browning going on Anytime you're working with these really thin cuts of beef Which are usually quite affordable That you really want to get the browning going because that's where all of your flavor is gonna be Now I'm in an uncrowded a single layer here in a very hot pan Best to do this in a cast-iron pan because it holds and distributes heat very beautifully And a 12-inch cast-iron pan is very very affordable Okay, so I've got these cooked through now, this is a well done piece of beef always done Well done And so I'm gonna lay them over here and then let the pan recover a little bit Double check that I have enough fat and then I'm gonna sear the other bunch of them here Now the last thing to do with this meat is to cut it up and In the taco stalls, in the markets, in the little taquerias, in the street stalls They always chop this really thin cut beef stick into much smaller pieces So I'm gonna say about a quarter of an inch is what I'm doing I took each one of those long pieces and cut it in a thirds or fourths and then I'm chopping that up You'll oftentimes see the taqueros doing this with really big knives and in case sometimes Even they'll use two knives to go back and forth and chop up the beef stick So I'm gonna put this all back in the pan I've turned the temperature of the pan down from the medium high to about a medium low now Because our final step here is to mix those caramelized onions with this chopped up beef stick And we want the flavors to mingle a little we want everything to get heated together and Be ready for serving here So I'm gonna scoop in the caramelized onions your ratio should be sort of the equal amounts of the onion and The meat a little less on the onion boy Does that smell good and as this is starting to warm up together? It gives me a chance to just clean up my board here Boy it does smell good. The caramelized onions are just great if you want to give it this is totally optional But if you want to give it a little boost of umami Then I would suggest that you take a little bit of Worcestershire sauce in Mexico They would likely use the hugo Maggi for this another booster of umami flavor So you can just a little bit of it less than a tablespoon is plenty for this and it will evaporate And season the meat there. I think I should give it a taste and see if we're Bacon is totally the ringer here. So good. Okay now building tacos I'll take a couple of tour taught tortillas here and lay them on a plate and Then I am going to spoon Some of our beef stick in sebo yado over the top of it Like that I like to use the roasted tomatillo chipotle Salsa, we've got another video on how to make that a little bit of Mexican queso on yeho that sort of strong cheese or you could use Romano or Parmesan over the top of it just a little bit of it and then I've got some nice fresh cilantro leaves to go over that No No raw onion on this one because we're really emphasizing the flavor of the caramelized onion And there you have I think the best Tacos, they'd be steak in sebo yado that you could make"}, {"title": "Six-Ingredient Jalape\u00f1o Salsa | Rick Bayless Taco Manual", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ir_yBejuyvY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLDyj_TEU4Vx8fYjka8hlTaizYmCIQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir_yBejuyvY&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=46&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "A velvety jalapeno garlic salsa. \u266a\u266a Hi, and welcome back to my kitchen. The next page in our taco manual takes us to a salsa that's not all that well-known, but I will tell you it's one of my absolute favorites. It's a creamy or a creamy textured jalapeno salsa. Very few ingredients, but when it comes together, you're going to love its texture and its brilliant green chili heat. So we've got three jalapenos here. Jalapenos just get bigger and bigger, so these look enormous here. I'm going to cut them in half. I do have to take the stems off the top of them, so I'm going to pop that off of it. You don't have to take the little stubs off, but you do want to take most of the stem off. Okay, now they're going to go into a skillet. I have this skillet heating over about a medium-high heat. Let's say that. And I have six cloves of garlic that are peeled already here and a cup of olive oil. Now, this could be made with regular vegetable oil, and lots of people in Mexico do make it with vegetable oil. I like the flavor of the olive oil, so that's what I'm going to be using. And out of this cup that I have measured out already, I'm going to coat the bottom of this skillet kind of heavily. So it's going to get the full cup of the olive oil in there, but we're going to start by saut\u00e9ing the chilies and the garlic. I will tell you, it's going to take you about five to seven minutes to get these guys browned and cooked all the way through. That's the most important thing, is that they're completely soft all the way through. So when they are ready, when they're richly browned, I'm going to turn off the heat and let them cool to room temperature before we continue. These are completely cool to room temperature now, beautifully browned, especially the garlic, because this is a type of emulsified sauce. So you think of hollandaise sauce or mayonnaise, and those are emulsified sauces where you're pouring slowly in the oil. But usually in those, you've got eggs as the emulsifying ingredient. This is going to be not only all that garlic that's here, but also the flesh of the chili. So we're going to put those all now into the blender jar, because we're going to add the oil here to this delicious-looking set of ingredients. I'm going to put a little bit of cilantro in there just because I like to have it blend in with everything else. I'm going to put the top on here and dislodge this center piece here. Turn on the blender. It'll start to make a puree, and then I'm going to slowly add the oil to it so that it gets emulsified in, and this oil is what's going to give it that creamy texture. So it's very smooth. That's what I'm looking for texture-wise here. And I need to season it with salt. I'm going to start with a half, a generous half teaspoon of salt here, but it might take a little bit more than that. And then lime juice about, I'm going to say about a half a lime that I'm going to put in there. Squeeze that in. That'll also thin it out just a little bit. It's kind of thick right now. All right, now let's blend those things in. Now let's pour it in here. Creamy. Look at how beautiful that is. And the cilantro has given it such a beautiful color. It's got the richness of that roasted garlic. It's got the brightness, of course, of the jalapenos and the cilantro that went in there. A little more brightness from the addition of the lime juice. I mean, it's like one of the most perfect salsas ever. I hope you love making this."}, {"title": "Red Chile Pork Tamales for the Holidays!", "img": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8W5nc5c61kM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLBvMLB46QphWZClF3YKYEGDA0ZEqA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W5nc5c61kM&list=PLpdGGiEC40GIjyl8aXPv-mlLWeHX3FXxl&index=47&pp=iAQB", "transcript": "Red chili pork tamales are the perfect thing to serve at the holidays or whatever occasion you're celebrating. \ud83c\udfb5 Hi everybody and welcome back to my kitchen. Today it is all about tamales. Now I am very excited in a couple of weeks I'll be getting on a plane and going to Oaxaca to celebrate Christmas as I always do and there will be posada after posada and they all end with this great big party where they will be serving tamales and they will be serving ponche and there will be pi\u00f1ata after pi\u00f1ata broken and candy everywhere but it's the tamales that are really at the heart of all of that and it's not just the eating of the tamales it's also in the making of the tamales. So today I'm going to show you how to make 24 tamales. Now that may seem like a lot to you but in Mexico that is nothing. People would laugh at me for making so few. Usually they get a whole crowd of people together and make hundreds of tamales because that's what they need for the posadas. Now the first thing that we have to talk about is the corn husks and the tamal steamer. So a package of dry corn husks you can find in lots of grocery stores certainly in every Mexican grocery store and you just cover them with water and let them soak until they're very pliable. That could take anywhere from a couple of hours to overnight. I usually like to put the water on them the day before I'm going to make the tamales. But it's the steamer for the tamales that you have to really understand because they're six inches tall and so you have to have something that is deep. If you have a soup pot say and you put one of those collapsible vegetable steamers in it you could use that. That for a lot of people will be absolutely the easiest way. Now this is a real classic tamal steamer that you can buy at pretty much any Mexican grocery store. Water goes in the bottom of it. I've already put a couple inches of water in the bottom of it and you fill it to just the line that you can see indented here. And that indentation is what supports this part here that goes in that all of the tamales will stand on so the water is boiling underneath. So we're going to set that one to the side. I'll show you a couple of other things. This is a very cute little tamal steamer that I bought at the little Mexican grocery store really close to my house. But this kind of a steamer, this one is actually for asparagus. I don't exactly know why I have an asparagus steamer but if you have an asparagus steamer or something like that it works really great. Just remember you need about this much space underneath the tamales and then six inches above. That is the depth that you need to work with. Okay our next step is to make the filling and I'll meet you back here in just a second. Okay I'm all set up here to do the red chili pork filling and the red chili in this filling is guajillos in this case. Guajillos are really bright flavored and that's what will work really well in these tamales. You need to take the top off of them, the stem part like that and then I just tear them open with my fingers. Some people like to go in with a pair of scissors but that takes too long and I just tear them open like that. And then you want to get most of the seeds out of them. And the next step is just to tear them into smaller pieces. This will make the blending go more smoothly. I'm going to tear the one up that I was working on when we first started here and then I've got one more to go here. And now let's talk about the pork that's going to go into this because the pork is going to be pork shoulder roast. Basically you're going to need a pound and a half of that to start with. To tell you the truth people in Mexico use all different cuts so if you have something that you like to simmer into a tender cut of pork then use that one but I'm using pork shoulder roast. Okay we're going to take all of these pieces of the guajillo chili now and for this particular recipe I am not toasting them. We're not making a sauce in that way and we have a long simmer with this pork so I'm going to put them in there and I'm going to throw in four cloves of garlic. The spices that are going to go into this one are black pepper and cumin and I just put them into this little molcajete that I keep around for just these small amounts of spices. It works really good and if you've never ground spices right before you use them you are in for an incredible treat because the aroma that's coming up to greet me right now is part of the fun of the cooking of all of this. Okay so I've got it pretty well ground now. You see it doesn't take very much time if you're working with the molcajete. That's why I was encouraged for people to bring one back when you visit Mexico. Even a small one like this just to be able to do your grinding of your spices. I always keep a small brush here so that I can brush out the molcajete. I have a couple of different small ones but the one that works the absolute best is the molcajete from Mexico but I have one that's made out of ceramic and then I have another one that's made out of marble. Okay so now we're going to blend this. I'm going to go ahead and put the salt in here. We need a teaspoon of salt to go in here for the basic braise. It's not going to be our final seasoning of this but I'm going to pour in here about half of this water. This is six cups of water so I'm going to pour in here three of those cups of water. This is not an exact measurement. It's just to get this to blend really well. We'll add the rest of it to the pot. Okay I think that I'm about where I need to be on that. This blending will take a while because guajillos have notoriously tough skins. So I'm going to turn it on and we're just going to let it go until it's completely smooth. Okay with a high speed blender like this you'll be able to get it pretty smooth. If you don't have this kind of a blender don't worry. It's still going to come out good. But I can just rub this through my fingers like that and see that there's hardly any of the sort of grit that you would associate with the skins of the chilies. But don't worry about that if yours is a little coarser because we're going to strain this. Medium mesh sieve, nothing fancy at all. The kind that you can buy at any grocery store. And I'm going to pour that sauce in there. And then we're going to strain it. I usually like to grab a spatula like this one and press it through. And as I'm pressing it through I start to see a collection at the bottom here of bits of skin. That notoriously tough skin of the guajillos. And that's what we're trying to eliminate here so that the finished filling doesn't taste sort of gritty. So it's a fairly simple procedure there to get that out. But I'm going to show you what I've got left. And I have a high speed blender here. So yours may be a little bit more in the bottom of your strainer. But here I've got it collected. That much is just the skins. Okay so I usually tap the strainer like that. And then I'm going to get that out of my way over here. Remember we have the other half of the water to put in here. And then we have all of this meat. So I cut it up into about half inch pieces. You don't want really big pieces for tamales. So about half inch pieces is the right thing to put in here. And you'll notice that I didn't cut all the fat off because tamales are rich. And that fat will actually season this sauce incredibly well. Okay so now I'll turn this guy on to about, let's see, I'm going to say about a medium heat. This will take an hour to an hour and a quarter for that meat to get really tender. But also for the sauce to reduce because you want it to be a thick sauce. So you're going to keep going with that and then we'll come back and we'll season it after that. Okay this is just right in terms of thickness now. You can see it holds its shape very very easily in a spoon. So it's reduced the right amount. Now we started with a little bit of salt in here. But you want this to be just a kind, just a touch salty. So I'm going to put just a little bit more. It doesn't need much but I'm going to put just a little bit more in there. And now we're going to let this completely cool before we start using it to make the tamales. So I'm just going to slide it off there. Okay now we're on to making the batter for the tamales. And I've got pork lard here. I know that that will probably scare some of you off that I'm making these with pork lard. You can use vegetable shortening for this if you want to. But I will tell you one of the things about great tamales is that beautiful pork flavor. So you will be missing that. So I'm a traditionalist so I would go for the pork lard for it. But use vegetable shortening to your own discretion. Now I've put it into this mixer and I've got the mixer set up here with a paddle. I'm going to put two teaspoons of salt in here. And then I'm going to put a teaspoon and a half of baking powder. And that we are going to beat with the pork lard here. Okay so we've got those measured in. This will take about a minute or so to get this really light and fluffy. You should notice a difference in the texture. Okay this pork lard right now looks like buttercream. I mean it's really really light and fluffy. We are making a special kind of tamale that they make in the central part of Mexico that is very light and fluffy. If you go to Oaxaca they're more pudding light. Out in the Yucatan definitely pudding light. There's all different kinds of tamales but I'm making the one from central Mexico. Okay so I'm going to turn this off now and I'm going to start adding masa. But we've got to talk about masa here. So I have two options for you. One is easy and one will take you to a tortilleria to buy the special masa for making tamales. So this is the special masa for making tamales. It's the only thing that we use in our restaurant. But we're lucky because we get a delivery from this really great tortilleria every single day. Now if I take this and I press it together like that it will hold together. But you can see it's very coarse and it's quite dry. So it can also crumble like this. Okay the other thing that you could use is masa harina. And this is the this stuff completely dried out and then packaged and sold in the grocery stores along with flour and sugar. I mean this is something that is very shelf stable. So all you have to do is rehydrate this because this is very damp. You have to rehydrate this and I give you in the recipe the amount of liquid that you would be adding to rehydrate this product here. Okay so now that I've turned this off I'm going to open it up and just scoop in about a third of what's here. It's easier to do this in stages here because it's too hard to mix the whole thing. But once you see that it's all been incorporated then do that same thing again scooping in another third of this masa that we have here. And then I'm going to mix that on low speed into it. And now we've got the last little bit of the masa going in here. And then to make these into a beautiful tamal that is very fluffy as is appreciated in the central part of Mexico. We are going to beat it and add liquid to it right now. Okay so here is going to go a little bit of our broth. You may wonder how you make vegetarian tamales because I know lots of people like them. You would use a vegetable stock here and of course you would use a little bit sloppy there. And of course you would use a vegetable shortening for the fat here. But just always think about tamales as special occasion food. They're not just everyday food. And I always think of them sort of like croissant. They have to be really rich or they're not going to be good. Otherwise you just have a crescent roll. Now what we're looking for here is the consistency of like a cake batter. That's what it's going to come out like when it's got the right amount of broth in here. I always say to people put in about a cup of this, two-thirds of the amount that we're going to be working with. And then look at it. If it looks like really, really thick cake batter, it's not ready yet. So I'm putting a little bit at a time in here but it's getting right to the right consistency. And one more after this and I will have all of this broth in here. Okay. Now I'm going to beat it for just a little while to get as much air out of it as possible. I'm going to beat it for just a little while to get as much air as I possibly can into it. Okay, it's been beating for a couple minutes now. And now I'm going to do the standard Central Mexico test. Which is to put about a half a teaspoon of this into some ice water and then see if it floats. If it floats it means that you've beaten in enough air. So I'm going to take a little bit of that here and then lay it down on the top like that. And of course you can see that it floats really beautifully. And now we know that we're ready to start making tamales with this tamal batter. Now on to the fun part of making the tamales. We've got that beautiful light batter over here. We've got our cooled filling here. I went through the corn house already and I chose the largest ones. About 24 of them there. But they need to be about 6 inches or so across. At least 7 inches long but all of these are way longer than that. There's some rejects over here. Out of the rejects I pulled a bunch of strings to tie the tamales with. So you would just grab it at about, well that's not a good one at all. So let's go in a little bit further here and I'll show you what one would look like. Because you want them to be really long. So you pull them at about a quarter of an inch and then you just run down like that. And I've got about 24 of those. You might want to do extras because there will probably always be a few that will break when you're tying the tamales. From my rejects I'm going to just line the bottom of our steamer here. So I'm going to put some one way and some the other just so that all of the holes are covered. So that when it starts steaming here you won't have a lot of direct contact between the tamales and the steam. But a very beautiful steamy environment. That's all you need there. Okay so let's start here with one that's ideal. Okay this is an ideal size corn husk. I'm going to take a quarter of a cup of the batter and I'm going to measure it. I would recommend that you do this by measuring the first few times that you do it. Because you have to understand what the proportions of these are. And you're going to go to about a four by four square here. Leaving about a half an inch on this big wide side that's closest to you here. And you want to have a little bit of space on the sides as well. Then I'm going to go in with about a tablespoon and a half of the filling right down the middle. Like that. And then you pick up the two sides to encase that filling. So you just pick them up like that. Bring the two sides together. Okay like that. Then I just roll them around like that and fold it underneath right at that point. Now this is where you're going to grab one of your ties and pick this up and tie it like this. Now you can see here and I think this is important for everybody to see. That we have a tear in this corn husk. And so I've lost a little bit of the stuff there. But that broke. That corn husk broke. So this is the way that you would handle that. You would put that down like this. Excuse me I turned it the wrong way. You would put it back down like that. And then you would just go ahead and tie it again like that. So that you didn't waste what you had there. Okay so I'm going to tie this one again. Clean up my board and then show you another one of these. Okay let's try that one again. I'm going to take my quarter cup of masa and put that on this wide end here. And spread it out into a square. Now you don't spread it out to cover the whole thing. You go like that. Okay then I put my about one and a half tablespoons of the filling in the middle. Just about that much. Pick it up. Encase that filling. I think I got a tiny bit too much there. Encase that filling like that. Roll it around. Flip it underneath like that. I usually will just kind of give it a little tap. Just to secure everything down there. And then I am going to tie it with one of our pull ties. You can use strings too if you don't have enough of the corn husks. Or if you prefer that look. Okay there we go. And then stand them up in the steamer. And I'll meet you back here when all those are filled. Tamales are all done and they're standing up in the steamer. But there's a big gap on one side. Because this tamale steamer would easily hold probably three and a half dozen tamales in this style. And so I've got to fill that with something. Otherwise during the steaming they could migrate down. Okay so I want to make a nice wall here if you will. So that they can sit up against it. So I just upended a small bowl in there. That'll do part of it but it's not quite enough. So I'm going to take a little bit of foil. And then very loosely crumple it like this. And then that can go down on one side here. And I'm going to do another one on the other side. Where I think it's going to need a little bit of support. So just like that. They're not packed tightly because you want the baking powder to do its thing. And the masa will expand a little bit. They'll grow a little bit taller. That's why you leave that little gap at the top. So that they can grow taller. Top goes on. I've got this right now over a high fire. And I'm going to let this go until I see steam puffing out of the top. Then I'm going to reduce the heat. So that they can cook now over this next hour, hour and a quarter. At a gentle steam. Some people like to throw a coin in the bottom of this. Before they put this whole thing together. Because the coin will just bounce around. That way you know if the coin stops bouncing. That you're out of water. In which case you would put hot water into the side of it. So just trickle it down into the bottom. But these will go for about an hour, hour and a quarter. For them to be fully cooked. I'll show you what that's going to look like in just a second. Anybody that has grown up with tamales for special occasions. Loves this aroma. The aroma that's just wafting over me right now. Now these have been on for a little over an hour now. And I am going to show you how you check to see if they're done or not. Grab a pair of tongs and we'll just pull one out here. Okay. So you slide off the, or cut it off. You could just cut the little tie off if you want to. And then unroll it. Like that. Okay so it came away. You have to see this. So it really easily came away from the corn husk. And that's what we're looking for. If it sticks to the corn husk at all. Then just fold it back up and put it back in. And let it go for another 10 or 15 minutes. Something like that. But I really like to pull a bunch of them out. And serve them in some kind of a deep. You can serve them straight from the tamalera here. The tamal steamer. But if you're going to pass them around. Then my suggestion is to fill a sort of deep vessel for them. At least enough for everybody to have one. You can come back and refill it with hot ones from the steamer. But so you have them like that. And you put them out on the table. And then you can serve them with salsa if you want to. But there's salsa on the meat that's on the inside. So it's not really common to serve them wet. If you want to make a kind of pretty package with them. You can unfold the corn husk. Leave them in here or put a couple of them in here. Put your salsa on the top of it. And then it's more of a formal presentation. But most people are going to be serving these for parties. And so the idea of just pulling one out of the steamer. Or grabbing one from this bowl that I have here. Unwrapping it yourself. Because these are like little gifts that you get. And then just digging into it. And there's the payoff."}]
