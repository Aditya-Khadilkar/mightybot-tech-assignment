## 2. Offer a Variety of Fillings:
One of the keys to a successful taco party is providing a variety of delicious fillings. One excellent option is rajas con crema, a filling made from roasted poblanos cooked with caramelized onions. This savory and flavorful filling is sure to be a hit. Additionally, you can offer two more fillings of your choice to cater to different tastes and preferences.

## 3. Don\'t Forget the Tacos:
Of course, you can\'t have a taco party without the tacos themselves! Purchase or make a sufficient quantity of taco shells or tortillas for your guests. Soft tortillas work great for traditional tacos, but crunchy shells can add a delightful texture as well. Ensure you have enough for everyone to enjoy multiple tacos.

## 4. Add Some Sweet Treats:
After enjoying the savory tacos, it\'s always nice to offer a sweet treat for dessert. Consider providing a variety of interesting Mexican candies. Place them in a big bowl for your guests to help themselves. Alternatively, you can serve your friends some refreshing ice cream to cleanse their palates.

Additionally, having a bottle of white wine and a bottle of red wine on hand will cater to different preferences.
